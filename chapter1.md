# Digital Literacy

Welcome to the online learning orientation course for Trinity Western University.

This course is designed to provide you with multiple opportunities to think about the impact of digital tools on you, your family, your friends, and your colleagues and to begin to take steps towards regaining control over your digital identify. Participation in online/digital spaces is not a neutral endeavour. There are risks as well as rewards. Often, unfortunately, the risks fall disproportionately on those who exist in traditionally marginalized communities like people of colour, women, sexual minorities, religious minorities and others. Conversely, it is those already in privileged positions who tend to reap the benefits.

Knowing this, we need to prepare you to be able to protect yourself, especially if you are in a vulnerable community, or to protect those around you who are more vulnerable than you.

## Why is digital literacy important?

In December 2013, the Senior Director for Corporate Communications at the internet company IAC was fired from her job. The reason that she was fired was that there was a massive global response to something that she did. She sent a tweet.

Justine Sacco was traveling from New York to Cape Town, South Africa to visit family for the holidays and, on a layover at Heathrow, she tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers:

> Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!

Then she wandered around Heathrow for a half-hour and, as she boarded her flight, turned off her phone.

While she slept on the 11-hour flight over Africa, a writer named Sam Biddle found her tweet and retweeted it to his own followers. All 15,000 of them. Before long, parts of the internet were in a frenzy of rage and then, glee. The top trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide was '\#HasJustineLandedYet'. Not only were people angry at the pious privilege and racism of Justine's tweet, but they were giddy at the thought of what was going to happen when she turned her phone back on.

The fallout from sending that one tweet was devastating for Justine. [You can read more about Justine's \(and others'\) story here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html)

If the career and personal life of a communications professional like Justine can be destroyed by a single tweet, then surely we need to exercise care and caution when engaging on the web. One lesson that we all need to consider is that activities on the internet are not made better by them being on the internet. Adding technology to an environment, whether it is a social environment or a learning environment, does not necessarily make that environment better. Generally, adding technology, especially technologies that encourage network effects, acts as an _amplifier_. That means that some good things can be spread more widely, increasing the positive effects of activities, but it also means that bad things can also be spread more widely and quickly.

Had Justine understood how much her tweet could be amplified by the way that the web \(and Twitter\) works, she might have made a very different decision and not sent that tweet. Sam Biddle did understand the power of the web to amplify messages, and he consciously used that knowing that Justine would be victimized. A digitally literate person ought to make wise and strategic decisions about what they share on the web.

#### Questions to consider.

1. Have you ever witnessed or experienced negative fallout for something you or someone else said online?
2. Have you ever participated in publicly shaming a person or organizations for something that they said online?

## Protecting Yourself

One of the first things that you should do to protect yourself online is to consider how you are protecting your own data and information. Many websites require that you sign in before you can fully participate in the site. This allows the owner of the site to track who you are and what you do on their site. Popular sites generate enormous amounts of data on you and your online activities, and that may not really concern you. Many people think that they have nothing to hide, so they have nothing to worry about.
