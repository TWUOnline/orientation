# Digital Literacy

Welcome to the online learning orientation course for Trinity Western University.

This course is designed to provide you with multiple opportunities to think about the impact of digital tools on you, your family, your friends, and your colleagues and to begin to take steps towards regaining control over your digital identify. Participation in online/digital spaces is not a neutral endeavour. There are risks as well as rewards. Often, unfortunately, the risks fall disproportionately on those who exist in traditionally marginalized communities like people of colour, women, sexual minorities, religious minorities and others. Conversely, it is those already in privileged positions who tend to reap the benefits.

Knowing this, we need to prepare you to be able to protect yourself, especially if you are in a vulnerable community, or to protect those around you who are more vulnerable than you.

## Why is digital literacy important?

In December 2013, the Senior Director for Corporate Communications at the internet company IAC was fired from her job. The reason that she was fired was that there was a massive global response to something that she did. She sent a tweet.

Justine Sacco was traveling from New York to Cape Town, South Africa to visit family for the holidays and, on a layover at Heathrow, she tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers:

> Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!

Then she wandered around Heathrow for a half-hour and, as she boarded her flight, turned off her phone.

While she slept on the 11-hour flight over Africa, a writer named Sam Biddle found her tweet and retweeted it to his own followers. All 15,000 of them. Before long, parts of the internet were in a frenzy of rage and glee. The top trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide was '\#HasJustineLandedYet'. Not only were people angry at the pious privilege and racism of Justine's tweet, but they were giddy at the thought of what was going to happen when she turned her phone back on.

The fallout from sending that one tweet was devastating for Justine. She lost her job and instantly became a paraiah. Her family's name was tarnished even after years of fighting against apartheid in South Africa.
