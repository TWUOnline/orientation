# Digital Literacy

Welcome to the online learning orientation course for Trinity Western University.

This course is designed to provide you with multiple opportunities to think about the impact of digital tools on you, your family, your friends, and your colleagues and to begin to take steps towards regaining control over your digital identify. Participation in online/digital spaces is not a neutral endeavour. There are risks as well as rewards. Often, unfortunately, the risks fall disproportionately on those who exist in traditionally marginalized communities like people of colour, women, sexual minorities, religious minorities and others. Conversely, it is those already in privileged positions who tend to reap the benefits.

Knowing this, we need to prepare you to be able to protect yourself, especially if you are in a vulnerable community, or to protect those around you who are more vulnerable than you.

## Why is digital literacy important?

In December 2013, the Senior Director for Corporate Communications at the internet company IAC was fired from her job. The reason that she was fired was that there was a massive global response to something that she did. She sent a tweet.

Justine Sacco was traveling from New York to Cape Town, South Africa to visit family for the holidays and, on a layover at Heathrow, she tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers:

> Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!

Then she wandered around Heathrow for a half-hour and, as she boarded her flight, turned off her phone.

While she slept on the 11-hour flight over Africa, a writer named Sam Biddle found her tweet and retweeted it to his own followers. All 15,000 of them. Before long, parts of the internet were in a frenzy of rage and then, glee. The top trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide was '\#HasJustineLandedYet'. Not only were people angry at the pious privilege and racism of Justine's tweet, but they were giddy at the thought of what was going to happen when she turned her phone back on.

The fallout from sending that one tweet was devastating for Justine. [You can read more about Justine's \(and others'\) story here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html)

If the career and personal life of a communications professional like Justine can be destroyed by a single tweet, then surely we need to exercise care and caution when engaging on the web. One lesson that we all need to consider is that activities on the internet are not made better by them being on the internet. Adding technology to an environment, whether it is a social environment or a learning environment, does not necessarily make that environment better. Generally, adding technology, especially technologies that encourage network effects, acts as an _amplifier_. 

That means that some good things can be spread more widely, increasing the positive effects of activities, but it also means that bad things can also be spread more widely and quickly.

#### Questions to consider.

1. Have you ever witnessed or experienced negative fallout for something you said online?
2. Have you ever participated in publicly shaming a person or organizations for something that they said online?
