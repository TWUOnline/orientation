Welcome to the Digital Skills portion of your orientation. During this section, you will be introduced to some of the tools and web services that you may use as an online student or faculty member at TWU.

##### WordPress

You might know WordPress as a blogging platform, but there is so much more that can be done with WordPress than just blogging. In fact, close to 25% of all websites on the internet are built using WordPress. We hope that your WordPress site will become your _domain_ on the web.

A domain can refer to a number of things, as Audrey Watters writes

> _Domain_ is a territory controlled by a state or government. It can refer to a specific sphere of knowledge. It also means home. It means a space on the Internet marked by a specific address and controlled by an individual or organization. \[[Source](http://reclaim.hackeducation.com/)\]

Your first activity in this course will be to set up your own WordPress site which will become part of your personal digital learning environment. You will have several options for how you would like to structure that space, and we will lead you through various options. The key is, though, that it is _your_ space. You are free to style it as you want and make it reflect your preferences and personality. Once you are done here, you can export your site and host it on your own site if you'd like. 

Currently \(Fall 2017\), only one course that we know of is offered through WordPress, but there may be more out there.

##### Moodle

The Learning Management System \(LMS\) that TWU uses is called Moodle, and it is accessible at https://learn.twu.ca. You need a TWUPass account to sign in. Most courses at TWU have a component that is run through Moodle. 

For assistance using Moodle, please see our KnowledgeBase articles [here](https://trinitywestern.teamdynamix.com/TDClient/KB/?CategoryID=4592).
