# Digital Learning Environments

Welcome to the Digital Skills portion of your orientation. During this section, you will be introduced to some of the tools and web services that you may use as an online student at TWU.

You may want to bookmark this page and refer back to it until you are more comfortable with how to use the various services.

## WordPress

You might know WordPress as a blogging platform, but there is so much more that can be done with WordPress than just blogging. In fact, close to 25% of all websites on the internet are built using WordPress. We hope that your WordPress site will become your _domain_ on the web.

A domain can refer to a number of things, as Audrey Watters writes

> _Domain_ is a territory controlled by a state or government. It can refer to a specific sphere of knowledge. It also means home. It means a space on the Internet marked by a specific address and controlled by an individual or organization. \[[Source](http://reclaim.hackeducation.com/)\]

Your first activity in this course will be to set up your own WordPress site which will become part of your personal digital learning environment. You will have several options for how you would like to structure that space.
