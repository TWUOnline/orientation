In next week's assignment you will try to create a short story out of just sound effects (no dialogue), the DS106 Sound Effect Story assignment. To prepare for this, you can start trying to find or record five or more sounds you can piece together for a story. What can you tell in five sounds?

#####Activity: Find or record sounds you can edit together to create a story

The story can be about a project you are working on, or an accomplishment, or something related to a research project you may be engaged in (or just use sounds related to one of your string interests).

You can either record sounds or find ones that are licensed for reuse. Some places to find sounds include:

<ul>
 	<li><a href="http://www.freesound.org/">Freesound</a> (free but you need to create an account to download)</li>
 	<li><a href="http://macaulaylibrary.org/">McCauley Library</a> (Cornell Lab of Ornithology) offers wildlife sounds.</li>
