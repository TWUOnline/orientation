### Annotating U

The purpose of this activity is to
- introduce you to [hypothes.is](https://hypothes.is) as an open web tool that you can use in your own courses to annotate public web documents;
- get you thinking about scholarship on the web as having distinct advantages over traditional face-to-face (f2f) learning environments; and,
- help you to begin to build a sense of community with your fellow learners.

Hypothes.is is a very light-weight web service and browser extension that you can easily install in your own browser and then use to have conversations _in situ_ on web documents such as blogs, articles, documents, websites, and other resources.

1. Sign up for [hypothes.is](https://web.hypothes.is/start/). It's free and easy.
2. Install the Chrome add-on or, if you use a different browser, drag the bookmarklet to your bookmarks bar.
3. Go to the [2016 Manifesto for Teaching Online](https://onlineteachingmanifesto.wordpress.com/the-text/) created by online educators at the University of Edinburgh.
4. Launch hypothes.is in your browser and scroll down to the text of the manifesto (below the video).
  - click the arrow to open the hypothes.is overlay

5. Read some of the public annotations that are already there and add your own thoughts.
6. Use the tag 'twulearns' in your annotations so that we can easily filter our own annotations.
7. Create a new post on your blog and write about this activity in light of your own teaching practice.
