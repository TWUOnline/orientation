# APA Style

Will this work?

The MA Leadership program uses the [_Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association \(6th ed\)_](http://www.apastyle.org/manual/) for formal papers. You are strongly encouraged to purchase this book to use as a guide as you write your papers.

There will not be any formal training or required readings from the book, but your instructors understand that you are learning to engage in a scholarly community and will be happy to assist you with specific questions.

To help you become more familiar with APA style, we have provided the following resources and activities for you.

### The Manual

The APA manual is over 250 pages of detailed explanations about how to write a paper or book in the social sciences. It is a reference manual, not a book to be read as a narrative. It is important to be able to format your work consistent with APA requirements, and to ensure that ideas that are not your own are properly cited and referenced.

It is expected that you will make APA mistakes in your writing, especially early in your program, and each of your faculty will be concerned about different stylistic and formatting devices.

Essentially, the manual was created to provide consistency regarding the ethics of research in the social sciences, the formatting of documents, and ensuring that authors are properly credited for their work.
