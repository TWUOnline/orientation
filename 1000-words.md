One of the key ways to add flair to your site and make it more interesting is to use images. You may know that there are billions of images 'available' on the internet, but that doesn't necessarily mean that you have permission to use any image that you find.

The best way to ensure you have permission to use the images you do is to create those images yourself! You do not need to be a professional photographer with oodles of expensive equipment to create interesting images. If you have a smartphone, you likely have a very good camera within arm's reach right now. In fact, it has been said that the best camera for you is the one you have available.

The activities[^1] on this page will give you some ideas and practice with taking better photos without you having to purchase any equipment.
