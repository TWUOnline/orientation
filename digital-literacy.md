##### What is digital literacy?

> "The capacity to make meaning with digital tools." Bonnie Stewart

It is concerned with the process of handling data rather than accumulating data.

We mentioned a definition of digital literacy in the introduction to this course, but, as is true for many things, it's not quite that simple.

Mozilla, the makers of Firefox, have created a Web Literacy Map that highlights key skills and activities associated with digital literacy in the 21st century. For now, we can consider digital literacy and web literacy to be synonymous. The map will allow you to explore each of the different domains and skills. Take a few minutes to visit the site and consider their definition of digital/web literacy.

##### Listen

Bonni Stachowiak from the _Teaching in Higher Ed_ podcast interviewed Bryan Alexander on the topic of digital literacies and how the idea has changed over the last decade.

While you listen, think about how the ideas that Bonni and Bryan talk about apply to your experience as a citizen in a digital world, then talk about digital literacy with someone.

One advantage of using podcasts as a format on the web is that users can listen to a podcast while they are doing something else that doesn't require significant cognitive effort, like driving, doing the dishes, or exercising. This allows people to capture time that would otherwise be taken from learning if the medium was text.

##### Why is digital literacy important?

In December 2013, the Senior Director for Corporate Communications at the internet company IAC was fired from her job. The reason that she was fired was that there was a massive global response to something that she did. She sent a tweet.

Justine Sacco was traveling from New York to Cape Town, South Africa to visit family for the holidays and, on a layover at Heathrow, she tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers:

> Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!

Then she wandered around Heathrow for a half-hour and, as she boarded her flight, turned off her phone.

While she slept on the 11-hour flight over Africa, a writer named Sam Biddle found her tweet and retweeted it to his own followers. All 15,000 of them. Before long, parts of the internet were in a frenzy of rage and then, glee. The top trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide was '\#HasJustineLandedYet'. Not only were people angry at the pious privilege and racism of Justine's tweet, but they were giddy at the thought of what was going to happen when she turned her phone back on.

The fallout from sending that one tweet was devastating for Justine. [You can read more about Justine's \(and others'\) story here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html)

If the career and personal life of a communications professional like Justine can be destroyed by a single tweet, then surely we need to exercise care and caution when engaging on the web. One lesson that we all need to consider is that activities on the internet are not made better by them being on the internet. Adding technology to an environment, whether it is a social environment or a learning environment, does not necessarily make that environment better. Generally, adding technology, especially technologies that encourage network effects, acts as an _amplifier_. That means that some good things can be spread more widely, increasing the positive effects of activities, but it also means that bad things can also be spread more widely and quickly.

Had Justine understood how much her tweet could be amplified by the way that the web \(and Twitter\) works, she might have made a very different decision and not sent that tweet. Sam Biddle did understand the power of the web to amplify messages, and he consciously used that knowing that Justine would be victimized. A digitally literate person ought to make wise and strategic decisions about what they share on the web.

##### Questions to consider

1. Have you ever witnessed or experienced negative fallout for something you or someone else said online?
2. Have you ever participated in publicly shaming a person or organizations for something that they said online?

##### Protecting Yourself

One of the first things that you should do to protect yourself online is to consider how you are protecting your own data and information. Many websites require that you sign in before you can fully participate in the site. This allows the owner of the site to track who you are and what you do on their site. Popular sites generate enormous amounts of data on you and your online activities, and that may not really concern you. Many people think that they have nothing to hide, so they have nothing to worry about.

Consider the following video.

Keep in mind that if the site that you are using is 'free', then the site and its services are not the product; you are the product. Your online habits are being scrutinized and subsequently bought and sold so that the original site and sites that purchase your data can more effectively sell you things.
