<h3>Welcome to the World of WordPress!</h3>

Your TWU online course may use a web environment called WordPress to show the course content, such as lessons, instructions, resources, etc.. You might also be asked to submit assignments through WordPress in the form of a blog or portfolio.

WordPress is an open source web publishing platform and has several benefits, such as:

<ul>
    <li>An open url (anyone can visit the site unless it is marked as private). This also means you can visit the course even after your studies are complete.</li>
    <li>Students can create their own WordPress site (e.g. blogs or portfolios), and share their assignments with instructors, their class, and others as desired.</li>
    <li>Students' websites can be automatically syndicated to the main course hub.</li>
</ul>

One of the most important components of learning at TWU is that students are immersed in a supportive community. We hope that as you make use of the tools and interactions in WordPress, you can build an online learning community with your class and beyond.

<h4>So where do we start?</h4>

If your course uses WordPress to host its content, you will be sent the url for the course site (beginning with https://create.twu.ca).  This website is the <em>course hub</em>. You will come here for updates from your instructor, to find out what your learning activities and assessments will be for the course, and also to read what your colleagues are writing in response to the prompts in the course (if they post assignments online). You might want to bookmark the course hub page, as you will visit there often.

The course hub is open and available to the general public and some of your work will be seen here, so please be careful what you post. Note that you have the option of making pages private as well, or posting using a pseudonym.

<h4>Moodle</h4>

At the beginning of your course, your instructor likely alerted you to the course site in Moodle, which is at <a href="https://learn.twu.ca">learn.twu.ca</a>.  Moodle is where some course activities may take place, where you can send and receive confidential messages, and access the discussion forums, which are only accessible to registered students. For instructions on how to use Moodle, see here, as well as see our <a href="https://twonline.gitbooks.io/moodlefaq/content/">Knowledge Base articles</a>.

<h4>Student Assignments on WordPress</h4>

Your course may require you to create your own WordPress site for an assignment, such as a blog or portfolio.  This is a great way to share your learning journey and to have meaningful discussions with peers about the course content.

Each participant in the course will have control over their own personal website. Some of your work will take place on your own site and be published to the web. While we encourage you to publicize your work, there may be very good reasons for you to either work under a pseudonym or to keep your work private using the settings on your own site.

In order to participate in the course, you must submit the URL for your site to your instructor. Your instructor will then connect your site with the course hub through RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Once your site is connected through RSS, your posts on your own site will be syndicated and show up on the course hub.

To start, click on <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/digital-skills/wordpress-set-up/">WordPress Set Up</a>. This will lead you through the process of creating and beginning to set up your site and your RSS feed.

If you don't need to have a personal site to post assignments, feel free to go back to the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/">Home Page</a> and continue with other tutorials to improve your digital skills.
