Your TWU online course may use a web environment called WordPress to show the course content, such as lessons, instructions, resources, etc.. You might also be asked to submit assignments through WordPress in the form of a blog or portfolio.

You might know WordPress as a blogging platform, but there is so much more that can be done with WordPress than just blogging. In fact, close to 25% of all websites on the internet are built using WordPress. WordPress is an open source web publishing platform and has several benefits, such as:
<ul>
 	<li>An open url (anyone can visit the site unless it is marked as private). This also means you can visit the course even after your studies are complete.</li>
 	<li>Students can create their own WordPress site (e.g. blogs or portfolios), and share their assignments with instructors, their class, and others as desired.</li>
 	<li>Students' websites can be automatically syndicated to the main course hub.</li>
</ul>
One of the most important components of learning at TWU is that students are immersed in a supportive community. We hope that as you make use of the tools and interactions in WordPress, you can build an online learning community with your class and beyond.
<h4>So where do we start?</h4>
If your course uses WordPress to host its content, you will be sent the url for the course site (beginning with https://create.twu.ca).  This website is the <em>course hub</em>. You will come here for updates from your instructor, to find out what your learning activities and assessments will be for the course, and also to read what your colleagues are writing in response to the prompts in the course (if they post assignments online). You might want to bookmark the course hub page, as you will visit there often.

The course hub is open and available to the general public and some of your work will be seen here, so please be careful what you post. Note that you have the option of making pages private as well, or posting using a pseudonym.
<h4>Moodle</h4>
At the beginning of your course, your instructor likely alerted you to the course site in Moodle, which is at <a href="https://learn.twu.ca">learn.twu.ca</a>.  Moodle is where some course activities may take place, where you can send and receive confidential messages, and access the discussion forums, which are only accessible to registered students. For instructions on how to use Moodle, see here, as well as see our <a href="https://twonline.gitbooks.io/moodlefaq/content/">Knowledge Base articles</a>.
<h4>Student Assignments on WordPress</h4>
Your course may require you to create your own WordPress site for an assignment, such as a blog or portfolio.  This is a great way to share your learning journey and to have meaningful discussions with peers about the course content.

Each participant in the course will have control over their own personal website. Some of your work will take place on your own site and be published to the web. While we encourage you to publicize your work, there may be very good reasons for you to either work under a pseudonym or to keep your work private using the settings on your own site.

In order to participate in the course, you must submit the URL for your site to your instructor. Your instructor will then connect your site with the course hub through RSS (Really Simple Syndication). Once your site is connected through RSS, your posts on your own site will be syndicated and show up on the course hub.

To start, click on <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/digital-skills/wordpress-set-up/">WordPress Set Up</a>. This will lead you through the process of creating and beginning to set up your site and your RSS feed.

If you don't need to have a personal site to post assignments, feel free to go back to the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/">Home Page</a> and continue with other tutorials to improve your digital skills.

<h3>A Note About Privacy</h3>
Some of the courses that you will take as part of your degree are designed as 'connected courses'. There are several reasons for this decision and also several implications for you as a student.

The vast majority of online learning at universities today takes place inside a Learning Management System (LMS). You may have encountered Moodle, Blackboard, D2L BrightSpace, or Canvas at another institution and may be familiar with their structure. An LMS is good for creating course rosters and managing grades or file transfers, but one significant problem is that all of the work that you do as a student then lives in a software system that you do not control. Once your degree is completed (at some universities, right after your course is completed) all of your work is deleted from the LMS. Another problem is that, during the time of a course in an LMS, you and your colleagues will build a certain degree of community and connectedness, but once again, after the course is completed, that community ends because nobody is ever signing in to that course anymore. When the course ends, the conversation ends.

To counter these disadvantages of LMSs, we are running some of our courses in a system called WordPress. Doing this allows you to retain control over your work. When your course or degree is complete, you decide what you want to do with your work. You can export your work to your own domain with a few clicks, you can choose to just download an archive of all your work and save it, or you can delete everything. The key point is that <strong>you</strong> are in control of your own work.

Furthermore, the community that you develop over the time of a particular course doesn't have to end, because your connections are not dependent upon everyone accessing the same site in an LMS. Your connections are your connections and they will persist after your course is done, and hopefully well after your degree is done.

One significant implication of this decision is that your work in your courses is open on the web by default. We need to be up front about this because you may have a need for privacy because of where you live, where you work, or other situations where your name cannot be posted on the web. We understand this and are happy to help you protect yourself online. We are going to have you work through some activities to help you determine your level of comfort with sharing your growth on the web, but for now, there are some things that you can do to ensure that your privacy is protected on the web.
<ul>
 	<li>Sign up for WordPress under a <strong>pseudonym</strong>. You do not have to use your real name on your blog. Just make sure that your instructor knows who you are and what your pseudonym is.</li>
 	<li>Use the <strong>privacy controls</strong> in WordPress to protect your work. You can set passwords on individual pages and posts, or set them to be completely private. Just be aware that your instructor will need to be a user on your blog if you want to use private pages.</li>
 	<li>Don't have a public 'About Me' page.</li>
 	<li>Go to 'Settings -&gt; Reading' and change the privacy settings for your entire site.</li>
</ul>
