<h1>Trinity Western University<br/>Online Learning Orientation</h1>

Hello!</p>

Welcome to the online learning orientation for Trinity Western University.

This website covers a number of topics, including how to use WordPress and Moodle, as well as other digital tools you may use for assignments, such as e-portfolios, blogs, Pressbooks, PowerPoints, Prezi, podcasts, videos, and more. 

We will also cover key knowledge and skills you will need in your courses and careers, such as understanding your digital identity, maintaining online privacy, searching online, and other digital skills.

Some of you may feel comfortable online as you navigate new technology, whereas others may be more hesitant. Whatever your experiences, we know that learning in an online environment can be challenging. We hope this website helps you succeed and thrive as you use technology to enhance your learning experience at TWU.

To get started, we want to encourage you to first read through your <strong>course syllabus</strong>.  There is likely information provided about what technology is required for the course.  Based on your needs, please select from the menu below.  In addition to learning about specific tools, please browse through the Digital Skills pages.  You might be surprised how important these lessons will be as you continue to learn and work online.

Please feel free to complete the activities suggested in each section, either in your personal learning notes or by sharing your learning online through your blog.  These activities are not graded or submitted to an instructor, but you will get helpful feedback from me (Colin), as well as your peers.  One of the goals in using this platform and participating in online activities is to build a learning support network, so feel free to connect and share your learning!

As you get started, please email me at Colin.Madland@twu.ca if you have any difficulties!

I’m looking forward to learning with you and getting you set up for success in your studies at TWU.

Colin
