The MA Leadership program uses the [_Publication Manual of the American Psychological Association \(6th ed\)_](http://www.apastyle.org/manual/) for formal papers. You are strongly encouraged to purchase this book to use as a guide as you write your papers.

There will not be any formal training or required readings from the book, but your instructors understand that you are learning to engage in a scholarly community and will be happy to assist you with specific questions.

To help you become more familiar with APA style, we have provided the following resources and activities for you.

##### The APA Manual

The APA manual is over 250 pages of detailed explanations about how to write a paper or book in the social sciences. It is a reference manual, not a book to be read as a narrative. It is important to be able to format your work consistent with APA requirements, and to ensure that ideas that are not your own are properly cited and referenced.

It is expected that you will make APA mistakes in your writing, especially early in your program, and each of your faculty will be concerned about different stylistic and formatting devices.

Essentially, the manual was created to provide consistency regarding the ethics of research in the social sciences, the formatting of documents, and ensuring that authors are properly credited for their work.

##### Resources

There are many online resources available to you as you work to implement proper APA style in your writing.

1. The APA Manual
2. [Purdue University Online Writing Lab \(OWL\)](https://owl.english.purdue.edu/owl/resource/560/01/)
3. [TWU LibGuides](http://libguides.twu.ca/citation_style_guides)

##### Managing Citations

We highly recommend that you use citation management software to help you with citing sources and creating your reference list. There are many products available and you should use one that supports your workflow.

Examples include:

1. [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) is free and open source and includes browser bookmarklets to help you save citations from online sources and databases. Zotero integrates well with MS Word.
2. [Bookends](http://sonnysoftware.com/) is a premium product for MacOS only and integrates with several word processors.
3. [EndNote](http://endnote.com/) is likely the most common product, but is pricey \(although there is a free, web-based version\).
4. [Cite This For Me](http://www.citethisforme.com/ca) \(formerly RefMe\)

You should note that, while citation management is very useful and will save you an enormous amount of time, it is not perfect. You need to ensure that you check your citations and reference list for errors.
