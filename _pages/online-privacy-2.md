There are several benefits to sharing your work online.  To highlight a couple:
<ul>
 	<li>It can <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>contribute</strong></span> to a <em><span style="color: #000000;"><a style="color: #000000;" href="http://wenger-trayner.com/introduction-to-communities-of-practice/">Community of Practice</a>,</span></em> or <em>Community of Learning</em>. This online community can live beyond the time your course ends, and can be the start of some great conversations and innovations beyond the TWU student body.  Consider this an opportunity to develop professionally and make meaningful connections.</li>
 	<li>It can help you <strong><span style="color: #ff0000;">succeed</span> </strong>in your courses at Trinity.  Many find that when they post assignments online, they put more effort into their work, as they know others will review it and learn from it.</li>
 	<li>It can <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>inspire</strong> </span>others.  Whether they are your peers, instructors, colleagues, etc., you may find that your work challenges and encourages others in their personal and professional lives.</li>
 	<li>By using an online platform such as WordPress, you retain <span style="color: #ff0000;"><strong>control</strong> </span>over your work. When your course or degree is complete, you decide what you want to do with your work. You can export your work to your own domain with a few clicks, you can choose to just download an archive of all your work and save it, or you can delete everything. The key point is that <strong>you</strong> are in control of your own work.</li>
</ul>
<h4>Privacy Concerns</h4>
One significant implication of posting assignments online is that your work in your courses is open on the web by default. We need to be up front about this because you may have a need for privacy because of where you live, where you work, or other situations where your name cannot be posted on the web. We understand this and are happy to help you protect yourself online.

Consider your level of comfort with sharing your growth on the web.  If you're not quite sure, there are some things that you can do to ensure that your privacy is protected on the web.
<ul>
 	<li>Sign up for WordPress under a <strong>pseudonym</strong>. You do not have to use your real name on your blog. Just make sure that your instructor knows who you are and what your pseudonym is.</li>
 	<li>Use the <strong>privacy controls</strong> in WordPress to protect your work. You can set passwords on individual pages and posts, or set them to be completely private. Just be aware that your instructor will need to be a user on your blog if you want to use private pages.</li>
 	<li>Don't have a public 'About Me' page.</li>
 	<li>Go to 'Settings -&gt; Reading' and change the privacy settings for your entire site.</li>
</ul>
