This activity will give you some insight into how our perceptions, biases, and fears are fed by the technology we use. You will also learn some helpful strategies for refining your searches in Google.

##### Activity 1

What does Google tell us about us? In a previous activity, you performed some searches on your own name. Hopefully that process helped you to understand a little more about the importance of maintaining and curating your online presence. In this activity, you will explore how Google in particular is not simply a 'search engine' helping you find the things that you need, but it is also powerfully shaping our culture in ways that may be subtle if you are not looking for them. 

Here are some things that you should pay attention to in this activity:

* Before you run a search, try to predict what types of images will be displayed.
* What ethnic categories are shown in the results \(Caucasian, Asian, Aboriginal, African\)?
* How are different genders portrayed, both within the same search and between different searches?
* What suggestions are provided at the top of the results page?
* What other things strike you as being important?

To begin, log out of all of your social media accounts, especially Google, then perform image searches for the following terms. To search for images, go to google.ca, type the search term in the field and click 'Google Search', then click 'Images' at the top of the search listings.

* professor
* teacher
* leader
* doctor
* nurse
* boy
* girl
* teenager
