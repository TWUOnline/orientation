## Online Learning Orientation

Welcome to the online learning orientation course for Trinity Western University.

This course is designed to provide you with multiple opportunities to think about the impact of digital tools on you, your family, your friends, and your colleagues and to begin to take steps towards regaining control over your digital identify. Participation in online/digital spaces is not a neutral endeavour. There are risks as well as rewards. Often, unfortunately, the risks fall disproportionately on those who exist in traditionally marginalized communities like people of colour, women, sexual minorities, religious minorities and others. Conversely, it is those already in privileged positions who tend to reap the benefits.

Knowing this, we need to prepare you to be able to protect yourself, especially if you are in a vulnerable community, or to protect those around you who are more vulnerable than you.

### Outcomes

1. Apply advanced search strategies to identify and select relevant open access resources to support learning.\*

## Course Structure

This short course is divided into two sections. Your program or instructor may have a third section that covers program specific details.

The first section covers the idea of _digital literacy_, which is

> the set of competencies required for full participation in a knowledge society. It includes knowledge, skills, and behaviors involving the effective use of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop PCs for purposes of communication, expression, collaboration and advocacy. \[[SOURCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy)\]

Becoming more digitally literate will help you to communicate ethically and effectively in TWU's digital learning environment as well as in your personal and professional life outside of the university.

The second section will help you develop some _digital skills_ required for you to participate easily and efficiently in various digital environments.
