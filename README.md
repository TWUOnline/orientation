## Course Structure

This short course is divided into two sections. Your program or instructor may have a third section that covers program specific details.

The first section covers the idea of _digital literacy_, which is

> the set of competencies required for full participation in a knowledge society. It includes knowledge, skills, and behaviors involving the effective use of digital devices such as smartphones, tablets, laptops and desktop PCs for purposes of communication, expression, collaboration and advocacy. \[[SOURCE](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_literacy)\]

Becoming more digitally literate will help you to communicate ethically and effectively in TWU's digital learning environment as well as in your personal and professional life outside of the university.

The second section will help you develop some _digital skills_ required for you to participate easily and efficiently in various digital environments.
# Digital Learning Environments

Welcome to the Digital Skills portion of your orientation. During this section, you will be introduced to some of the tools and web services that you may use as an online student at TWU.

You may want to bookmark this page and refer back to it until you are more comfortable with how to use the various services.

## WordPress

You might know WordPress as a blogging platform, but there is so much more that can be done with WordPress than just blogging. In fact, close to 25% of all websites on the internet are built using WordPress. We hope that your WordPress site will become your _domain_ on the web.

A domain can refer to a number of things, as Audrey Watters writes

> _Domain_ is a teritory controlled by a state or government. It can refer to a specific sphere of knowledge. It also means home. It means a space on the Internet marked by a specific address and controlled by an individual or organization. \[[Source](http://reclaim.hackeducation.com/)\]

Your first activity in this course will be to set up your own WordPress site which will become part of your personal digital learning environment. You will have several options for how you would like to structure that space.

# Digital Literacy

Welcome to the online learning orientation course for Trinity Western University.

This course is designed to provide you with multiple opportunities to think about the impact of digital tools on you, your family, your friends, and your colleagues and to begin to take steps towards regaining control over your digital identify. Participation in online/digital spaces is not a neutral endeavour. There are risks as well as rewards. Often, unfortunately, the risks fall disproportionately on those who exist in traditionally marginalized communities like people of colour, women, sexual minorities, religious minorities and others. Conversely, it is those already in privileged positions who tend to reap the benefits.

Knowing this, we need to prepare you to be able to protect yourself, especially if you are in a vulnerable community, or to protect those around you who are more vulnerable than you.

## What is digital literacy?

We mentioned a definition of digital literacy in the introduction to this course, but, as is true for many things, it's not quite that simple.

##### Explore

Mozilla, the makers of Firefox, have created a Web Literacy Map that highlights key skills and activities associated with digital literacy in the 21st century. For now, we can consider digital literacy and web literacy to be synonymous. The map will allow you to explore each of the different domains and skills. Take a few minutes to visit the site and consider their definition of digital/web literacy.

###### [Web Literacy Map](https://learning.mozilla.org/en-US/web-literacy/)

##### Listen

Bonni Stachowiak from the _Teaching in Higher Ed_ podcast interviewed Bryan Alexander on the topic of digital literacies and how the idea has changed over the last decade.

While you listen, think about how the ideas that Bonni and Bryan talk about apply to your experience as a citizen in a digital world, then talk about digital literacy with someone.

###### [Digital Literacy – Then and Now](http://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/digital-literacy-now/)

One advantage of using podcasts as a format on the web is that users can listen to a podcast while they are doing something else that doesn't require significant cognitive effort, like driving, doing the dishes, or exercising. This allows people to capture time that would otherwise be taken from learning if the medium was text.

## Why is digital literacy important? {#why-is-digital-literacy-important}

In December 2013, the Senior Director for Corporate Communications at the internet company IAC was fired from her job. The reason that she was fired was that there was a massive global response to something that she did. She sent a tweet.

Justine Sacco was traveling from New York to Cape Town, South Africa to visit family for the holidays and, on a layover at Heathrow, she tweeted to her 170 Twitter followers:

> Going to Africa. Hope I don’t get AIDS. Just kidding. I’m white!

Then she wandered around Heathrow for a half-hour and, as she boarded her flight, turned off her phone.

While she slept on the 11-hour flight over Africa, a writer named Sam Biddle found her tweet and retweeted it to his own followers. All 15,000 of them. Before long, parts of the internet were in a frenzy of rage and then, glee. The top trending hashtag on Twitter worldwide was '\#HasJustineLandedYet'. Not only were people angry at the pious privilege and racism of Justine's tweet, but they were giddy at the thought of what was going to happen when she turned her phone back on.

The fallout from sending that one tweet was devastating for Justine. [You can read more about Justine's \(and others'\) story here.](https://www.nytimes.com/2015/02/15/magazine/how-one-stupid-tweet-ruined-justine-saccos-life.html)

If the career and personal life of a communications professional like Justine can be destroyed by a single tweet, then surely we need to exercise care and caution when engaging on the web. One lesson that we all need to consider is that activities on the internet are not made better by them being on the internet. Adding technology to an environment, whether it is a social environment or a learning environment, does not necessarily make that environment better. Generally, adding technology, especially technologies that encourage network effects, acts as an _amplifier_. That means that some good things can be spread more widely, increasing the positive effects of activities, but it also means that bad things can also be spread more widely and quickly.

Had Justine understood how much her tweet could be amplified by the way that the web \(and Twitter\) works, she might have made a very different decision and not sent that tweet. Sam Biddle did understand the power of the web to amplify messages, and he consciously used that knowing that Justine would be victimized. A digitally literate person ought to make wise and strategic decisions about what they share on the web.

#### Questions to consider.

1. Have you ever witnessed or experienced negative fallout for something you or someone else said online?
2. Have you ever participated in publicly shaming a person or organizations for something that they said online?

## Protecting Yourself {#protecting-yourself}

One of the first things that you should do to protect yourself online is to consider how you are protecting your own data and information. Many websites require that you sign in before you can fully participate in the site. This allows the owner of the site to track who you are and what you do on their site. Popular sites generate enormous amounts of data on you and your online activities, and that may not really concern you. Many people think that they have nothing to hide, so they have nothing to worry about.

Consider the following video.

[https://youtu.be/33CIVjvYyEk](https://youtu.be/33CIVjvYyEk)

Keep in mind that if the site that you are using is 'free', then the site and its services are not the product; you are the product. Your online habits are being scrutinized and subsequently bought and sold so that the original site and sites that purchase your data can more effectively sell you things.
