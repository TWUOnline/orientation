Another way for you to personalize your site or add variety to your assignments is to record audio. This might seem a little more advanced than photography, but once you have played around for a while, it will become much easier.

These activities[^1] are intended to provide a brief overview of recording and sharing audio files. We will also briefly introduce you to [Audacity](http://www.audacityteam.org/), an open source audio editing tool.

##### Privacy Note

We will recommend that you sign up for some different web services in order to host your audio files. Please remember that you are not required to sign up for these services with your real name. Feel free to use a pseudonym or alias.

##### anchor.fm

[Anchor.fm](https://anchor.fm) is a free smartphone app for either iOS or Android \(you can also upload from your computer\) that allows users to quickly and easily record, upload, and share audio files. Keep in mind that 'ease-of-use' often means 'limited options', and this is certainly the case with anchor.fm. There is very little that you can do to edit your recordings after the fact, so you may have to record multiple times.

Take a few minutes to download the app, or go to the site on your computer, and listen to some of the recordings that are posted there, then record a clip or two yourself.

##### SoundCloud

[Soundcloud.com](https://soundcloud.com/) is another free \(with a paid 'Pro' option\) service that allows you to record and upload audio files. One advantage of SoundCloud is that it is extremely easy to embed a file in WordPress. All you need to do is copy/paste the URL from your uploaded file into its own line in a WordPress post or page, and WordPress will automatically display a SoundCloud player and embed the file into your post.

Create an account at Soundcloud and record or upload a clip.

##### TapeWrite
[TapeWrite.com](https://tapewrite.com/tapes/top) is yet another free-with-pro-options. I haven't actually used TapeWrite, but it looks interesting and I'd love to hear what you think.

##### Sharing Audio

Once you have created and uploaded audio clips in anchor.fm and SoundCloud share them in a new post on your blog and include some thoughts on the process. Was the app easy to use? Are you satisfied with the recording? What might you do differently next time? Was it easy to share from the app into your blog? Did you discover how to embed SoundCloud files?
