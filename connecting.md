The TWU Online MA Leadership is designed as a _connected_ course. That is, the courses are designed to build connections between participants and to foster interaction and community. Another word that many people use to describe connected courses is _participatory. _

In a connected course, your participation is critical not only to your own learning, but to your colleagues' learning as well. But it goes beyond that, too. Your instructors, while they have spent years studying leadership in many different contexts, don't necessarily know what you know about leadership. They are not only guiding you through the ideas in the course, but they are learning with you. Likewise, you have had experiences in leadership that your colleagues have not had and _vice versa_. The learning that you take from these courses will be directly related to the connections you make.

Not only will you connect with people, but you will also learn to connect ideas, and this is the heart of learning in any environment. You will not only learn to connect your current ideas with new ideas, but also with your colleagues' ideas as well as the ideas of some of the most important thinkers in your discipline. In the end, the ideas that you have about your discipline will be very different from the ideas you had before you started the program. This process of changing your ideas and situating them in the context of your discipline is difficult, but we hope to facilitate it in the design of our courses and the technology we use.

To do this, we have identified some foundational principles for online learning at TWU.
