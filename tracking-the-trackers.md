\[ted id=1436 lang=en\]

For this activity, you will need to be using Mozilla's Firefox web browser. [You can download and install Firefox here.](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/?scene=2)

Once you have launched Firefox,

##### Install Lightbeam

###### Go to 'Add-ons'

Click the 'hamburger' in the top, right corner of Firefox.

###### Think

Now that you have Lightbeam activated in Firefox, you'll be able to see exactly who is tracking you as you interact on the web. Spend some time visiting sites that you would normally visit, and periodically check in on the Lightbeam tab in Firefox to see what sites are most active. Keep LightBeam active for a few days and check in every once in a while.

###### Reflect

Create a new post on your blog and write a little bit about what you noticed using LightBeam. Some questions you might want to consider are:

* which site that you visited had the most trackers?
* how many of the trackers came from sites that you did not visit?
* how long does your normal browser keep cookies from third parties?

Use the categories 'Tracking' and 'TWU Online' in your post.
