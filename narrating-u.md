#Narrating U

As you begin your journey through higher ed, maybe for a second or third time, and maybe after a long time out of formal education, you will change and grow. Your views will change. You will become less confident in your previously-held ideas and conceptions about the world. You will begin to see events and ideas with a new, and more deeply thought-out perspective. Learning requires you to change. If you are not changing, you are not learning and you are not spending your tuition money wisely.

Sometimes, it is hard to look back and recognize how you have changed because the changes are subtle and they happen over a long period of time. Part of the structure of this program is that your own work is hosted on your own domain, your blog in WordPress. The reason for this structure is to allow you to explore your own growth and development over the course of the program and to reflect on the impact of those changes.

At regular points in each course, you will be asked to respond to specific questions or report on various activities on your blog and then to reflect on the process of completing that work. We hope that you will come to see your blog as a testing ground for your ideas. We don't expect you to have a complete understanding of everything at the beginning of your course or program. That would be silly.

We do hope that you will learn to narrate your process as you work through your program.

Now, that may sound like an odd request, but it is rooted in sound andragogy[1].
