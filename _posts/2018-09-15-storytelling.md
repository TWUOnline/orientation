These days, taking photographsÂ  is akin to breathing &#8211; not much effort involved and is practically automated. Most certainly when considering the ease of use alongside the mass proliferation of smart phone technology. In contrast to the standard rapid fire photography, those around me would probably say that I am quite rigid when it comes to photo spontaneity. I enjoy sunsets, seascapes and the art of adapting ones position to best align with background colour and landscape; and finally, perish the thought of ever taking a photograph cutting off feet, hands or heaven forbid, a head. In summary, I always take my time to get it as right as possible.

Thanks to David duChemin&#8217;s tips from his book titled, &#8220;Ten Ways to Improve Your Craft&#8221;, I included a picture of &#8220;lunch a la photog&#8221;.

<img class="alignnone size-medium wp-image-186" src="http://create.twu.ca/fourwinds/files/2018/09/IMG-2302-e1537039625960-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://create.twu.ca/fourwinds/files/2018/09/IMG-2302-e1537039625960-225x300.jpg 225w, https://create.twu.ca/fourwinds/files/2018/09/IMG-2302-e1537039625960-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" />

By choosing a black and white plate with only green and yellow ingredients, alongside white feta to offset white on plate, I was attempting to use duChemin&#8217;s tip on using colour to contrast. I made some attempts to shoot overhead, but this reduced the sense of depth; therefore, I shot the photograph from an angle of the diner to fill the frame and accentuate depth and range. Additionally, I chose to use window light as a natural accent to make the meal more appealing and healthy. I tried some of the other tips such as shooting overhead (boring/no depth) adding a different background and extreme close-ups, but those attempts reduced the appeal of the photograph. Ultimately, the photograph was good, but the meal was better.
