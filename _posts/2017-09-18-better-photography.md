<p>The tips that I used from David duChemin&#8217;s free ebook <a href="https://craftandvision.com/products/ten">TEN: Ten Way to Improve Your Crave. None of Them Involve Buying Gear</a> are:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Better Contrast Makes Better Stories: </strong>I wanted to take a photo where the contrast would be different than what I would usually quickly snap with my iphone. I liked that the background in this case has the brighter colours and the foreground was darker. I also thought it was funny that most of the subjects (my colleagues!) were looking out the window while one of them sat uninterested at the table. To me, the contrast between the interested and the disinterested subjects created a good story.</li>
<li><strong>Pay Attention to the Moment: </strong>We were all having lunch and my coworkers&#8217; interests were peaked by a car that was parked illegally in the lot outside. At this moment, I thought it was funny that something as mundane as an illegally parked car had caught our interest during our even more mundane lunch hour. I really like the candidness of this photo.</li>
<li><strong>Look to the light: </strong>The lighting in this photo is different than what I normally like. Generally I like to take photos in bright light. However, I think that having the light in the background in this photo really adds to the photo. Also, the darkness in the foreground makes my colleagues (mostly) unrecognizable, which is good, because I&#8217;m not sure they want to be featured on my blog.</li>
<li><strong>Put a Great Foreground in Front of a Great Background:</strong> I actually cropped this photo a little bit because I took this photo from farther away and in the original foreground, there were distracting factors like our staff room table and chairs.</li>
</ol>
<p>Overall, I am not sure if this photo is great and I know that there is much room for improvement in terms of my skills and technique. However, after reading David&#8217;s duChemin&#8217;s ebook, I am definitely more conscious of the way I take photos and I am more aware of the different components that go into taking a simple photo. I really do like this photo I chose though because seeing it reminds me of the moment and how I laughed with my colleagues about how easily we were amused.</p>
