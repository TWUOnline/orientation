In this last topic of the course, you will have an opportunity to learn some new skills and hopefully practice some old skills in a new way.

The first activity, some pointers on taking better pictures is a good reminder that adding visual interest to a post is a good way to enliven otherwise flat text. WordPress has a 'Featured Image' module on the post creation page which is a relatively simple way to ensure that your post has some sort of visual attached to it. The image you use doesn't even have to be related to the post, but it certainly can be.

Those of you who are using a blog at create.twu.ca can activate a plugin called 'Instant Images' which will add a button just above the post editor that, when clicked, will allow you to search unsplash.com for free, high resolution images, then automatically add them to your media library for use in your posts. The plugin also makes it relatively easy to provide attribution to theÂ  photographer.

Following that activity, we will dive into creating, editing, and sharing audio. This topic will require a little bit of downloading and setting up of some software, but that process should be relatively straightforward.

Audio is another way to break up the monotony of flat text, and it also makes it possible to take learning 'on the road'. I am physically unable to read while on a bus or plane, so having podcasts or audiobooks available makes it possible to engage with interesting stories and conversations.

Audio can also be an interesting way to provide feedback on student work in a more personal way.

Looking forward to your contributions!
