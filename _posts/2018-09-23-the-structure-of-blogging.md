As I began to set up my site with pages and a blog I leaned on my very basic knowledge of WordPress that I have been developing over the last year when our school moved to WordPress for our website&#8217;s platform.

It seems to me that as we gain more understanding of what is to come as far as content and outcomes in our leaning, the structure of my blog/ site will begin to take shape.

At this point, I have three simple pages that will become homes for some of the specific areas or topics of learning.  I am sure that more pages will be added to my site as time goes on.  I am interested in having my site feature different forms of media that will spark discussion.

Blogging is new for me so at this point I am feeling my way through the categories that we have been setting up for our first few posts.  I am starting to see the ease that categories and subcategories will bring to those navigating through various posts.

I am looking forward to developing a user-friendly structure within my site/ blog.

<div id="themify_builder_content-87" data-postid="87" class="themify_builder_content themify_builder_content-87 themify_builder">

    </div>

<!-- /themify_builder_content -->
