Today&#8217;s screenshot reports on 11 Internet visits although in fact I began my work for <em>Finding U </em>by searching with <em>Edge, </em>the Microsoft search engine. Only my visit to <em>Firefox </em>showed up, at the top of the screenshot. Interesting! This probably explains why <em>Firefox </em>reported on fewer visits yesterday than on Monday. Now I wonder whether my Internet visits would be more secure if I made <em>Firefox </em>and <em>Google </em>my default search engines. . .  I wonder if I&#8217;m the only one who faces this issue. Thanks for listening while I continue to experiment. . .
