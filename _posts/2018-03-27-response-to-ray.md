<p>Hi Ray,

If  you want to create a new page for resources on your website then you can just select &#8220;add new page&#8221; from the pages link on your dashboard menu.  As an example, I have created a separate page on my website for my favorite leadership resources.  You can view that page here:
<div class="post-embed">
<blockquote class="wp-embedded-content" data-secret="q0GiVhFRve"><a href="https://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/favorite-leadership-resources/">Favorite Leadership Resources</a>

</blockquote>



<iframe class="wp-embedded-content" sandbox="allow-scripts" security="restricted" src="https://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/favorite-leadership-resources/embed/#?secret=q0GiVhFRve" data-secret="q0GiVhFRve" width="600" height="338" title="&#8220;Favorite Leadership Resources&#8221; &#8212; Heather Strong"  marginwidth="0" marginheight="0" scrolling="no"></iframe>

</div>

Once you have created a new page then you can add the document you created by saving it as a PDF file on your computer.  Next, select the &#8220;media&#8221; link from your dashboard menu, upload the file, and then you can insert the file into your post.  The file will appear as a link on your website. Here is an example of a PDF file that I posted in my 591 course: <a href="http://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/files/2018/01/Example-APA-Title-Page-1.pdf">Example-APA-Title-Page</a>

Hope this helps!

Heather
