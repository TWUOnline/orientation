<p>Soooo&#8230;I thought forsure having dabbled in WordPress for work (tweaking my own business site) that it would have prepared me for this WordPress set up. Not so much. There is a huge difference between tweaking and building from scratch. WordPress had always been sold to me as not user friendly and I have to agree a little bit.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As a businessperson building my own company, visualization is a huge part of how dreams become a reality. So naturally I chose a theme that could have strong image presence and be pleasing to the eye. A picture paints a thousand words! Unfortunately, the photo uploads didn&#8217;t go as planned and the theme doesn&#8217;t present the way the example does. The App does not recognize my email or site most likely because its attached to the TWU create site. Not sure. &nbsp;It is however, a learning curve I&#8217;m determined to figure out!</p>
<p>Im structuring my site to look appealing and to have categories that are linear, helpful and easy to follow. Im still reading over all of the details of what can be added here and look forward to continuously improving the site.&nbsp;</p>
