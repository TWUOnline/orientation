As I wrap up my work through the Digital Skills unit of our course, let me share my observations about <em>Feedly</em> and the tools available on <em>Google Drive</em>.

<ul>
<li>I just opened <em>Feedly</em> on my computer and immediately noticed Colin’s introduction of the Digital Literacy segment of our course. Good! This is just what I expect will happen during my next TWU course—I’ll be able to consult Feebly for the latest posts without even opening the course website. I certainly agree with Colin that <em>Feedly</em> can be a real time saver. At the moment, my <em>Feedly</em> icon is on my computer desktop. Unless I can figure out a more efficient use of RSS feeds on the course hub, that’s the way I’ll likely work with <em>Feedly</em> in my next course.</li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>I remember learning a lot of digital skills from Karen Roeck, a recent LIP advisee, Indeed, I found that I would need to install Google Chrome to read and understand her LIP Report, because it included extensive interaction amoung teachers using<em> <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/v/-qTcDsbvbjk"  rel="noopener">Google Docs, Google Sheets and Google Slides</a></strong></em> for collaborative curriculum planning and writing in her school. She was a real inspiration to me! While working with her, I checked with some K-12 schools I had previously led, and it soon became clear to me that many teachers are taking advantage of these Google tools for writing curriculum documents, sharing them and commenting on each other’s work through them. In my experience, good teachers use these tools to facilitate the development of Professional Learning Communities in their schools.</li>
</ul>

I look forward to our upcoming conversations about digital literacy!
