<p>I used Lightbeam all weekend on Firefox to see the result from a weekend of work on Moodle and MyCourses population and replacing older links with up-to-date.</p>
<p>The result was interesting. The one cbc site I went to turned into a starburst of activity behind the scenes. I also ended up on a New York Times site from TWU, I don&#8217;t remember clicking. Like the CBC site. the NY Times site lit up like a starburst as well.</p>
<p>I shut down the browser each night, but the records show I visited 17 sites between Friday and tonight. In the process of connecting to those 17, I also interacted with 126 third party sites as well. A 7/1 ratio &#8211; 3rd party/direct connect.</p>
<p>Interesting information to glean my web traffic. I think I&#8217;ll keep it.</p>
