<p>Being a high school teacher, I have come to be very aware of what I share and what is shared about me on the internet. In fact, there have been many times when I have purposely gone through and removed content online that I do not want others (mainly my students!) to see. An example of this was the website I created for my wedding a few years ago. While there was nothing inappropriate on it, it felt private and I did not want the information to be available online after the occasion had passed.</p>
<p>From my search, the only sneak-peek that was available into my personal life was the picture (seen above) from my Instagram page. Of course, it also lists my Instagram account name, which leads to more pictures from my day-to-day life. My Instagram account used to be private to the public. However, I recently consciously changed it because sometimes I like to share my posts with friends and family who do not have an Instagram account. When I was a new teacher, it was really important for me to keep my personal life private. However, as I become more comfortable in my profession, I realize that even if students stumble across my page, it would perhaps make me more personable and human.</p>
<p>I like to describe myself as candid and friendly. As such, I try to portray this through my posts on Facebook and Instagram. While my Facebook page is quite hidden and cannot be found through a simple search online, I believe that my Instagram account does show this if one really does spend the time looking through all the posts! Having said this, I am always mentally self-censoring, making sure that things that I post are not at risk of being taken the wrong way or out of context. I am always making sure that any posts I like align with my values and beliefs. Sometimes it&#8217;s easy to &#8220;like&#8221; a post on Facebook or Instagram because it is posted by a good friend. However, I understand that everything I do online can be seen by others and I want to make sure that it only adds positively to my online presence.</p>
