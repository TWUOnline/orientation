I admit that this was more fun of an activity than I expected! I have always been interested in photography, however my photos always seem to be lacking and uninteresting. My teenaged daughter with her smartphone takes much more captivating photos than I do!

However, this was a very fun way to experiment with some specific photo elements that I had never done before. I have a new phone with more advanced camera settings, so it was a really neat way to try to use some of those. Racing the clock added another interesting element.

I chose to not go too far for my photos, and given that I love to garden, wanted to keep most of my photos within that theme. It would have been lovely had it been a sunny day, but it was an unsettled, cloudy, ominous day. There was even thunder in the background. Even so, the lighting created some interesting pictures. I loved the look of the sky and that it very appropriate for the &#8220;supernatural&#8221; pic. I thought the colours and shadows were so interesting and varied! For the similar colour photo, I was surprised that even though I chose a spot that was all green, when I actually looked at the picture and the colours within, they were really quite varied! I enjoyed taking several of the photos actually getting down in the dirt with my plants &#8211; this is something I often do in the early summer mornings &#8211; I just sit and weed right down in the dirt, watching the insects come and go. I love these pictures because they capture that serenity for me. I think my favourite picture is the one of my foot in the background. It puts the garden and foliage in the forefront, but my foot encapsulates my presence and tending of this little plot.

I added some of my favourite pics to a photo gallery widget on the front of my website!
