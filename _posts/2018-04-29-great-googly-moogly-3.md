From the images above it is clear to see the majority of the images are of Caucasian ethnicity. Searching professor returned images of mostly men that appear to be over the age of 50. Related search terms included university, scientist, hogwarts, and animated. In contrast, the images of teachers were majority women that look to be under the age of 35 and had related words like high school, primary school, thank you. A search of leader did not bring back any images of actual people which I found interesting. I think this shows that the concept of leadership is broad and is generally viewed as someone in front of a team of people. Youth, strong, business, effective were all related words. The biggest difference between doctors and nurses other than gender was the white lab coat! Doctors had more of a varied age range where nurses were mostly young. Cute, female, and student were related search terms for nurses but stethoscope, surgeon, professional, and specialist were linked to doctor. The search for boy and girl brought back images of children whose ages ranged from toddler to teenager.  The kids in the boy and girl searches were mostly smiling and appeared happy where as the teenage kids were depicted as screaming, frowning, and being on a cellphone. Words associated with teenager include angry and overweight.

I struggled a bit with the second activity. When I did my undergrad I always used the schools online resources to find peer reviewed articles and journals. The search engines were easy and I didn&#8217;t have to rely much on key terms. I tried looking up an academic article from Canada by searching <em>site:ac.ca Leadership</em> but no results came up. it took a few more searches but I did end up finding a thesis article from Western University &#8220;Improving the Education of Leaders: An Exploratory Case Study in an Undergraduate Business Leadership Course Focused on Gender&#8221; by Kanina Blanchard.  Finding a specific PDF on kitchen restaurant management was hard to find but I found a good one on general kitchen management. And I was able to find a podcast from Southern Alberta: https://soundcloud.com/albertaadvantage
