I have found that life brings us some interesting seasons whether we are ready or not.  In this case, I have chosen to be challenged by something new and so I had better be ready.  The paradigm of adventure has become important to me as an educational leader.  Framing challenges as adventures has provided a structure through which I can address what is ahead of me.

Setting out on a new pathway always brings an overriding spark of anticipation with a sometimes not so subtle undertone of curiosity and caution of what may lay ahead.  Continuing my education after significant break feels like the beginning of a new adventure.  I know that I have a lot to look forward to. I know there are going to be some mountains to climb but that there will also be many spectacular views to enjoy! I am looking forward to the journey and the comradery of others to journey with along the way.

I know that God leads us down paths in our lives that give us cause to become dependent on Him.  He allows us to be stretched beyond our own comfort zone and our own ability.  I look forward to being challenged, enlightened and inspired by the educational journey that lies ahead.
