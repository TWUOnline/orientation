Social media and technological abundance have done so much to change the world and it is likely that we are only beginning to learn of the impact these changes are having on society and culture.

Media exposure in the past would be the result of a press release, a press conference, some significant event worthy of a certain level of attention. Now every tweet, every photo on instagram, every post on facebook is able to receive the same level of notoriety as historic events which occurred before the arrival of social media.

As an early adopter when it comes to most things related to technology and specifically with social media, I&#8217;ve had a strong and active presence on facebook, twitter and instagram for years. While I&#8217;ve never found myself in any kind of relational controversy or global scandal because of anything I&#8217;ve posted there have been more than enough examples of unintended fallout from what people have posted online.

When every tweet carries the power of a press conference, the level of awareness and caution needs to match the level of consequence.

The summer of 2018 has seen numerous examples of professional baseball players being publicly shamed through the resurfacing of posts on twitter from several years ago. Despite claims of immaturity and personal growth, these athletes have still had to face criticism and consequence for their poor decisions.

The counterbalance is the question of whether or not there should be some statute of limitations on old posts and some forum to respond to allegations of hurtful intent when social media controversy arrives.

Should statements made 5, 10, 15 years ago be viewed through the same cultural lens as the identical statement would be if it were to be said today? Over time we see opinions and cultural norms change to the point where what was a joke or an insult a decade ago can became hurtful and atrocious in a modern context.

Responsibility lies with both the creators and the consumers when it comes to outrage and controversy online.

Two simple guidelines have helped me in my time with social media.

As a content creator, before posting (whether it&#8217;s on a social media network or on my personal site) I will pause, ask whether what I&#8217;m about to post is necessary and helpful and occasionally ask for an extra set of eyes to review. If there&#8217;s any question or concern or unclarity, I will generally not post.

As a content consumer, I try to always assume the best of the person who has posted. While we call itÂ <em>social</em> media the truth is that words on a screen carry almost no social cues and so we are often unable to completely accurately identify context, tone or intent. Assuming the best allows for me to be wrong and for the creator to be right, even though I may disagree passionately with what is being said.

One more overarching principle is the reminder that very few opinions have been changed or arguments been settled through back-and-forth on social media. Comments and replies generally spiral downward very quickly and move away from the original issue.

As awareness of the power of social media increases and the level of education continues to grow around online bullying and appropriate communication on social media, I believe we will see the power and potential of these technologies continue to grow. They are certainly not going away! As a global community we will need to learn to leverage these new forms of communication and understand the limitations found in each of them.
