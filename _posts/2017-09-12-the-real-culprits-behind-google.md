<p>The real culprits behind why Google does what it does are us.</p>
<p>I can see what this activity was getting at, and saw glimpses of how Google or other search engines start to cross a line of just supplying you with information to starting to supply you with certain information.  Google did predominantly supply images that fit into stereotypes, and also lad visual seekers to areas that others have searched before.  It seems to me that Google is just doing what it is programmed to do, and the real culprits behind why it is steering people into directions are because people have gone on before it.   Google is only programmed to do what Google does.  It is as if Google is displaying and trending a summation of what people have looked for in the past.  It is a clear indication as to how people feel, a look into the true hearts of those who search the internet.  It would be terribly interesting to be a data analyst working for Google.   It may just show the true nature of man.</p>
