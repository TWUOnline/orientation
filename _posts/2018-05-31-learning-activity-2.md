<strong><em>Three basic elements for effective leadership</em></strong>

In a journal of Virtues and Leadership, Spears (2010) has mentioned ten characteristics of effective and caring leader which a leader should adopt when coordinating a group project in an organisation.

The three listed characteristics among them according to me a leader should adopt are Listening, Awareness and foresight.

The most important thing a leader should adopt is listening, one can never understands other&#8217;s problem and request if he is not a able to listen properly. Listening is an active communication skill that a leader should adopt traditionally to listen people. Through this skill a leader is able to get attached to the inner sense of an employee and helps to build trust for him. As mentioned in the journal of Virtues and Leadership, Spears (2010) &#8221; Listening, coupled with periods of reflection, is essential to the growth and well-being of the servant leader&#8221; (pg. 27).

The second one is awareness, it means a leader should be aware of the things a happening around him and also aware of self-awareness. as mentioned in Journal Virtues of Leadership, Spears (2010) &#8220;Awareness helps one in understanding issues involving ethics, power, and values. It lends itself to being able to view most situations from a more integrated, holistic position&#8221; (pg. 28). It is very much required for an organisation to view goal with all the possible approaches available and be able to know what is actually happening around. As stated in journal of Virtues of leadership, Spears (2010) by Greenleaf (1977/2002), (p. 41). observed: “Awareness is not a giver of solace—it is just the opposite. It is a disturber and an awaken er. Able leaders are usually sharply awake and reasonably disturbed. They are not seekers after solace. They have their own inner serenity” (p. 28). Awareness is also necessary for self development.

The third characteristic is one of my favorite is foresight. As mentioned in the Journal Virtues of Leadership, Spears(2010) &#8220;Closely related to conceptualization, the ability to foresee the likely outcome of a situation is hard to define, but easier to identify. One knows foresight when one experiences it. Foresight is a characteristic that enables the servant leader to understand the lessons from the past, the realities of the present, and the likely consequence of a decision for the future&#8221; (pg. 28). Which means an ability to see the outcome of what we are doing. This is an important aspect, a skill, a knowledge a leader should have to be able to look clearly what all their work gonna be, will it be fruitful or not.

So, at least these three actions must always be kept with a leader for an organisation to run coordinately.
