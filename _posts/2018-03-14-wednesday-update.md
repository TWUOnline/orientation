Good morning everyone!

It has been good to see some of you getting signed up for WordPress and exploring the activities in this first week.

One thing you will almost certainly notice as you teach online courses is that a large portion of your students' work will take place over the weekend. This is especially true at the grad level. You already know that many of your students are mid-career professionals meaning that weekdays are usually entirely consumed with work and family obligations with little time for significant amounts of online interaction in your course.

This, combined with the fact that everything in collaborative environments takes longer online, means that you need to be patient; work through technical issues with your students before hitting them with piles of content to sort through. Changing minds is extremely difficult to do, but that is our task as educators, and we need to take a long view on the process.

### Some notes on Blogging
You should consider your blog as a place for you to try out new ideas, to test your assumptions, and to share what you are learning with your community.

Your blog should not be written in a formal academic style, but you should (like always) give appropriate credit to other people who have informed or inspired your thoughts. This can be done with a simple mention and link as a way to say thank you, [like this](http://cogdogblog.com/2017/02/beautiful-benches-and-attribution/). Or, you could activate the 'Inline Footnotes' plugin on your blog and use footnotes to provide an attribution[footnote]Like this[/footnote]. If you'd like to go full APA, you are welcome to do that, but you are not obligated to do so.

The point of your blog is to provide opportunity for you to do the work of learning in a non-threatening environment. It will be expected that you will be wrong about some things, or at the very least, that there will be discrepancies between what you now believe and what you used to believe, or what your colleagues believe. This is good. We want you to change your mind, and that is difficult work.

As such, you blog won't be graded for 'accuracy' or 'being right', but instead for depth of thought and evidence that you are learning new ideas and incorporating them into your mental schema for later application.

#### Blogging Logistics
When you are responding to a post, whether it is an activity in the course, or someone else's post, please consider composing your reply on your own blog and including, on its own line, a link to the post to which you are replying. This strategy allows you to keep all of your own work under your own control. If you leave comments on other's blogs, it is easy to lose track of where they are.

For example, if I am responding to another student, I should include the URL for that post like this:
```
https://create.twu.ca/learner/2018/03/14/hypothes-is-in-action/
```

Which will be rendered as

[https://create.twu.ca/learner/2018/03/14/hypothes-is-in-action/](https://create.twu.ca/learner/2018/03/14/hypothes-is-in-action/)

Some WordPress themes will display a snippet of the linked post for you, and the link will show up on the linked post as a comment called a 'trackback' letting the original poster (OP) know that someone has mentioned them.

One final note, you may have noticed that I recently disabled comments on this blog. This is an excellent strategy for keeping your site free of spam and abuse.

As always, please let me know if you need assistance getting set up or connected with any of the tools in this first week. You'll notice that I linked to castellon's post on hypothes.is  a couple paragraphs ago...have a look!
