I had fun with this final installment to our course, although I admit that it was also quite an experience for me to learn the basics of&nbsp;<em><a href="https://manual.audacityteam.org/"  rel="noopener">Audacity</a>.&nbsp;</em>Only after hours of practicing with the help of a number of&nbsp;U-Tube videos&nbsp;did I feel comfortable with putting together five short mp3 recordings and assembling them into my first audio tape. In addition to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gXfVKSx7WtY"  rel="noopener"><em>Alan Levine&#8217;s</em> </a>introduction, I found the videos published by <a href="https://youtu.be/fshLRl3GWqE"  rel="noopener"><em>Dusty Porter </em></a>and &nbsp;<em><a href="https://youtu.be/PrN9mYXvrsk"  rel="noopener">Rich Johnson</a>&nbsp;</em>to be especially helpful.

In planning this project I found that my skills as a piano tuner-technician gave me a head-start in constructing my sound-effect story. My model for it is&nbsp;<strong><em><a href="https://transom.org/2012/dissecting-joanne-rosser-papermaker/"  rel="noopener">&#8220;Dissecting Joanne Rosser, Papermaker&#8221;</a>&nbsp;</em></strong>by Rob Rosenthal. The outcome is a four-minute audiotape in which I show four segments of a tuning session at my own piano, introduced and interspersed with snippets from Scott Joplin&#8217;s&nbsp;<em>The Entertainer&nbsp;</em>(available free from the public domain) that fade in and out.<em>&nbsp;</em>I conclude the presentation with a few phrases of J.S. Bach&#8217;s well-known&nbsp;<em>Jesu Joy of Man&#8217;s Desiring&nbsp;</em>and, to show how good I felt upon completing the assignment, and this course, at the end comes a fireworks display and, fittingly, an applause. Enjoy!
