Hello everyone!

I have recently moved to BC from Ottawa, Ontario. I am looking forward to this new adventure and exploring everything that this beautiful province has to offer as well as developing myself in the MA of Leadership! Currently, I am working for an interior design company in south Surrey. Although I have zero experience in designing, I have a background in business so my job is to market and expand the company.

I believe that leadership ability ultimately determines an individual&#8217;s effectiveness to exhibit change in not only the organization they work for but also in the lives of those closest to him or her. Over the course of this semester, I am thrilled to work with  passionate achievers that understand that one&#8217;s ability to have a great impact in the world, directly correlates to having an extraordinary ability to influence and lead.

Looking forward to meeting you all!

Christina
