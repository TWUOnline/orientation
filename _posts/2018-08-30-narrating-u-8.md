<p>To be completely honest, working through this part of the orientation has been a bit of a challenge for me.  I am not so far removed from school that doing online course work is foreign, but customizing my own site and using WordPress and these types of digital skills is new territory to me. </p>
<p>I have been very systematic/acedemic with my categorizing and menu formation because I am still figuring out how I want to organize and personalize my site.</p>
<p>I think as I learn and begin to feel more confident with the program, I will be able to customize my site in a way that will best represent me and my interests.  I hope to create a site that is enticing, easy to navigate and is a lasting piece of self reflection and discovery.  </p>
