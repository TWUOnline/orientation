I really enjoyed working through this activity. I read through almost the entire blog in one sitting. One area where I struggled was with using the google reverse image search, I could not find &#8220;Search Google for image&#8221; to appear in the &#8220;context menu&#8221;. I&#8217;m using google chrome as my web browser so I&#8217;m not sure where I am going wrong. I though I was fairly computer literate but this course is teaching me that I have a lot to learn!

Reading laterally is a move that I plan on using to improve my ability to find quality web sources. I&#8217;ve done this in terms of reading what other say about companies, salons, stores, etc. But I have never done this as a way to fact-check the content of online information.
