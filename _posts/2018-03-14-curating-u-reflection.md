<p>Colin didn&#8217;t ask us to reflect on this activity, but I wanted to share some of my own experiences with you regarding feedly.</p>
<p>For those of you who have not taught an online course using word press, let me emphasize how important it is to have feedly.com set up for you as an instructor.  In the beginning of my course (before I read curating U) I was clicking on each individual students websites to see if they had posted a response to a learning activity.  Then I would go back into each of their sites the next day to see if a student had commented on a question that was posed. I had 12 students in my online class, and one week they had to post 5 blog responses (12&#215;5=60!!!) and then respond to a colleagues question (+12 more responses = 72 posts that I had to read in total that week!!).  This was tedious and time consuming to say the least.  Then I read curating U, set up feedly, and life changed drastically!  All of the students posts and their comments were in one place!  It was magical.</p>
<p>If you are instructing a course using word press and requiring students to blog for their learning activities this step is crucial.  It is the most efficient time (and frustration) saver possible.  My next task is to re-think how many blog posts student should post in one week.  I am still learning.</p>
