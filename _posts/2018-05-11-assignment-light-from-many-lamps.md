Taking reference from the book light from many lamps I have read a story by W. Beran Wolfe &#8220;to find a happiness we must seek for it in a focus outside ourselves&#8221;. This story tells the most basic idea of why people are used to be unhappy, no matter some are rich and some are poor rather billionaires are more potent to unhappiness, The fact is that people used to horde in achieving their goal, their ambition without self realization which put them away from being socialized and true happiness. taking reference from the story writer wrote &#8220;what is happiness ? and then began to answer swiftly by himself not only the rich person but a man building a boat, writing a symphony and educating his son, can be the most happiest person&#8221;. He mentioned a few lines &#8220;If you live only for yourself you are always in immediate danger of being bored to death&#8221;. These powerful words clearly describes the methods to adopt for being a good leader, a leader should never think only of his interest, of his goal attainment but also take care of people whom he is leading, always work in context of them a better leadership qualities is not only in the betterment of organisation but is in the growth and welfare of the workers too.

As well quoted by Ray Lyman Wilbur &#8220;unless we think of others and do something for them, we miss one of the greatest source of happiness&#8221;. It changed my idea of happiness as like others I have some ambitions and goals but never been able to think to also include social welfare in it. It is true by helping others the feeling of happiness is on another level, taking an example you gave some money to the needy one who is hungry and with your help able to eat some food, that moment can make you realize &#8220;the feeling of happiness is not inside rather to focus outside&#8221; (as in the story),

this makes me remember many incidents of my life and i begin to differentiate between the feeling of happiness while doing something for me and something for others and trust me it is better to do for others. This also helped me out regarding leadership training that how to deal with workers and make things for their happiness and changed the philosophy and meaning of a true leader for me.
