Traditional use of text books and black board learning for so many years , kept me away from learning advanced features in online learning and this extension of annotations using hypothesis has given me a new exposure and I should say I would definitely relay on this tool for all the future learning or web usage .

In the beginning when I read the instructions to start hypothesis I wasn’t sure where I am going to end up . Slowly I gained confidence as I was able to annotate and give reply to an existing annotation and finally felt so delighted after learning a new task . Moreover ,I could easily share the page to email for easy access .That was really interesting !!!

This extension is a great tool that could be used by anyone may it be school student or a grad. It&#8217;s definitely going to save a lot of time and confusions created by browsing different sites to find solutions.

Imbibing this tool will make MY learning and ANYONE much comfortable .
