I don&#8217;t think I know a single person who hasn&#8217;t seen the negative attacks on posts of others online. When creating online media everything is open to interpretation. Therefor the circumstances of the person reading and responding to the post greatly influence how they respond. To protect myself from participating or being victimized by internet rage I will be thoughtful and direct in what I create. I will read and respond to the work of other with respect even when I disagree.
