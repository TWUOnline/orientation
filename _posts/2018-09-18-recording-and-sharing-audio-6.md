If you have been following my posts, this will come as no surprise, that learning about and actually using Anchor and SoundCloud is something that I have never done.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>In fact, before this orientation I had never even heard of Anchor, have never needed to record or share audio files, or even listened to a podcast!<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>Please refer to my introductory post if you have any further questions about why. <span class="Apple-converted-space"> </span>

I found this exercise very interesting and easy to do.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>I was able to download the Anchor app, create a SoundCloud account and make a recording, however it did take several tries to get a recording that I was happy with.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>One feature I really liked on Anchor was how easy it was to trim the audio.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>From there, it took a little more time to upload the recording to SoundCloud and transfer it into WordPress, but it was not complicated.<span class="Apple-converted-space">  </span>The product of my recording is only attached through the link below.  For some reason, I had a very difficult time embedding the SoundClound player into WordPress.  I&#8217;m working on it, and if I can figure it out I will repost and edit.<span class="Apple-converted-space">    </span>
