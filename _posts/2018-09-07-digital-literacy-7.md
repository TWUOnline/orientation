In this century where one post or comment on any of your social media handle can risk your career, all future prospects and even life, it is of utmost importance to have the know how of how can one&#8217;s opinion be interpreted or taken in and out of context landing the concerned individual in an unforeseen and reprehensible situation.

Though not an avid user of social networking sites, my most frequented social site is Facebook, wherein, once in a while I do share my opinions and thoughts and at times share posts of other&#8217;s that are in line with my perspective about a given topic.

There have been quite a few instances wherein I have come across posts and comments that led to series of criticism , humiliating the author of such posts or comments. Of late it was of an employee working in an MNC who lost his job as a result of a post put up by him on his Facebook account. The post garnered attention from all quarters. If at all the concerned employee  had invested his/her time and energy in assessing the repercussion and backlash , if any, that would and/or could be the aftermath of such post, this could be avoided. Here is where the significance of digital literacy comes into the frame.

Being a civilized person it is the duty of every individual to be responsible while putting forth their thoughts and opinions on any public platform or social networking sites. Public shaming is an inexorable thing and one can avoid it by following 2 simple steps:

<ol>
<li>As the age old saying goes, &#8216;THINK BEFORE YOU SPEAK&#8217;  can very well be applied in this context.</li>
<li>As the present day saying goes, &#8216;Google Before You Post&#8217;, one must think about the chances of fallout such posts could have and post accordingly.</li>
