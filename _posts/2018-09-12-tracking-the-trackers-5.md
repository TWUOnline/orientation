And majority of the users like me are unaware or careless about the tracking sources available in search engines. I always used google chrome as my default browser and I have noticed that I get many advertisements in social media related to my internet search and it&#8217;s catchy as per my interest. However I neglected that because I thought it’s not going to affect me.</p>

<p dir="auto" style="text-align: left">As an exercise, when I downloaded Mozilla Firefox ,I felt  it’s much faster than google chrome and it’s my first time to track the trackers using light beam and I was surprised to see nearly 26 trackers were detected within the first minute after installation of light beam . Now I am aware about the seriousness and strongly recommend to have safe and secure internet browsing only because of this exercise . I have visited few sites in this short span, that are YouTube, manormaonline (native online news), Facebook, RBC online banking , Amazon, CNA website . I think more trackers are from Facebook out of these. It may depend on the time spent in each site and am not that clear with the logic. I have noticed that many of the trackers are from the sites which I have not visited too. So I believe that my habit of surfing should be scrutinized and the thoughts should go every angle when the internet is used because internet never forget anything and the users are under sharp surveillance. As per my knowledge, cookies remain there unless it is manually cleared.  This session was indeed very useful because it opened my eyes &amp; and felt ,very close and deep study is required regarding internet security. It will be definitely useful in near future.</p>
