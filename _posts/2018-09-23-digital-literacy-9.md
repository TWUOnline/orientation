This past weekend I witnessed a young person experience the unfortunate result of public shaming based on something they posted on a few online platforms.  The post that was made was clearly done in the heat of the moment and ended up backfiring on the person who made it.  While this was a careless mistake, I fear that further consequences and backlash are still to come.

After sitting through a number of training sessions about online safety for schools and seeing some of the devastating results of a misworded social media post,  I always like to save a draft of my initial thought or response and look at with fresh eyes.  The fact that everything we post online is ultimately there forever motivates me to take a think before I speak approach when it comes to online communications of any kind.

I will often have another person read an email or post to ensure that I have not made any careless mistakes.  I am thankful for some of the edits that have been suggested to me over the years.
