I chose to record my simple &#8216;Hello World&#8217; introduction. I found both apps very easy to use. I accidentally added to sound clips to the end of the anchor.fm app. I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to remove them. I really liked soundcloud. It was nice that you could pause and come back to the recording at a different time.
