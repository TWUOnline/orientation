Like anyone else ,my life itself is a blessing from the God Almighty and I am so blessed to be born in a traditional South Indian joint family in Kerala.Am proud to say that I am a sweet daughter to my parents,naughty sister to my brother and a lovely wife to my handsome husband Alphine Joseph.

I am a highly passionate,dedicated and enthusiastic Registered Nurse from India since 2014 with experience in Accident and Emergency nursing  from Mumbai.Later in 2016 ,moved to Vancouver for further studies to accomplish my dream of becoming an RN in British Columbia,which is still in process. In July 2017,I achieved title as an LPN [licensed practical nurse] with Alberta .As my goal is still in process,with the online studies of Return to Registered Nurse Program with Thompson Rivers University, I wished if I could do Masters in Leadership in Health Care so that I will be a great team player cum leader in which ever medical field I work .

I live in Delta ,with my two loving and caring roommates and I am waiting for my husband to join me soon as I am going to apply for my spousal visa.

I always had sportive leadership qualities since childhood which developed more stronger during my catholic convent degree college days where I was the Vice President of the Students Nurses Association .I was and is an all rounder in  co-curricular and extra curricular activities uplifting my spirit ,encouraging and supporting talented team members ,teaching and sharing whatever I know to kids and youth with our church related events ,annual celebrations,fund raising and volunteer activities. Though I am new, and temporary resident in BC, I didn&#8217;t leave my hobbies and leadership qualities behind ,rather I feel privileged to be a board member of Kerala Cultural Association of BC [KCABC ]and hold the position as an event coordinator.I enjoy team work and never get tired of listening to peoples&#8217; views and opinions may it be contradictory  .Self understanding of what I am and what&#8217;s lacking in me helps me easily understand others and be non judgmental . As the saying goes, &#8220;All that glitters is not gold&#8221; ,it even means on the other hand  whatever that doesn&#8217;t glitter is not coal.So everything has its own worth .

I don&#8217;t have any specific theories in life neither will I have in future,but I believe if God has given me this life ,it&#8217;s his wish and my responsibility to keep up my life to its best way possible,so keep going &#8230;..there is no limit to learning ,

There is no dead line to perfection ,always something new can reproduce from what we perceive as perfect,

Smile is a beautiful tool to repair negativity and that&#8217;s the only curve that does wonders with minimal effort,so keep smiling&#8230;

Acceptance of my ignorance in unknown fields gives me strength and positive energy to learn more and more and I am not ashamed of seeking help from anyone  in learning&#8230;&#8230;. we would not have been human if we were all perfect in everything &#8230;&#8230;so help and get help&#8230;..

Love unconditionally &#8230;may it be family ,other people ,work, or any activities .Never wait for something in return ,if we expect its not true love &#8230;.true love is awesome and no one has ever described it &#8230;its just amazing &#8230;.So LOVE everything you do with a clean heart &#8230;&#8230;.

In a nutshell , this is a bit about me &#8230;. I am blessed , I am a learner ,I am not perfect , you can expect smile ,I  accept my imperfections and corrections ,I Love myself and so I do love you all my brothern &#8230;.

I am so excited to learn with you all &#8230;.that&#8217;s a blessing &#8230;Thank GOD!!!!!
