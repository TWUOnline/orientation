<p>Looking at the images they are all very stereotypical and oddly enough for leader there are renderings of stick figures and animations.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A lot of the &#8220;teenager&#8221; images showed young people crying or being consoled which seems a bit odd depending on your perception of the teen years. Suggestions up top include race, emotional state and stereotypes. e.g. here:<img class="size-medium wp-image-3151 alignright" src="http://create.twu.ca/mavenbuilddesign/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-21-at-11.05.31-PM-300x181.png" alt="" width="300" height="181" srcset="https://create.twu.ca/mavenbuilddesign/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-21-at-11.05.31-PM-300x181.png 300w, https://create.twu.ca/mavenbuilddesign/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-21-at-11.05.31-PM-768x462.png 768w, https://create.twu.ca/mavenbuilddesign/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-21-at-11.05.31-PM-1024x616.png 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" /></p>
