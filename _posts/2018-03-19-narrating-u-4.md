Let me first respond to Heather&#8217;s insightful argument that people&#8217;s perceptions of others are &#8220;framed&#8221; by their outward appearance, especially in today&#8217;s Western culture in which people are sharing so many pictures and videos with each other. I completely agree. So, for your viewing pleasure, I begin this post with the photography of Jason Row. What you see above is the first of several pictures. The entire collection can be retrieved from the Site <a href="https://www.lightstalking.com/framing-with-frames/"  rel="noopener"><strong><em>How Framing with Frames Can Give You More Powerful Photographs.</em></strong></a>

The hours I spent on this course since my previous post were filled with moments of delight when I could say, &#8220;Aha! Now I know what this button is for.&#8221; But to be truthful, I also experienced many surprises when the buttons I clicked didn&#8217;t do what I expected.

The UMW DTLT videos were very helpful, but after seeing them I still needed to refer to several additional videos and guides while trying the various Dashboard options. Just for practice, I moved to a new site theme just to see what would happen. Then I investigated a number of options:

<ul>
<li><strong><em><a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/feedly/hipbfijinpcgfogaopmgehiegacbhmob?hl=en"  rel="noopener">I started organizing our course in Feedly</a>.</em></strong> Great experience! I will definitely use this program when I teach my next course MA Lead course&#8211;It will save me a lot of time, because the Moodle site doesn&#8217;t update me as efficiently on which students have posted and in what order. Additionally, this resource will become a place from which I can draw the bios and writings of the mainly authors featured in my course. In my Feedly I identified every fellow student and Colin as &#8220;feeds&#8221; and I also identified a &#8220;Board&#8221; which features the main authors and topics highlighted in my course. Another really helpful &#8220;feed&#8221; heading is Photography, which is becoming a virtual bank of great pictures I can use.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.gravatar.com/"  rel="noopener"><em><strong>I investigated Gravatar.</strong></em></a> Great tool&#8211;now my picture shows up in a lot of places on my site and elsewhere else where my posts are submitted, helping everybody sort out who wrote what.</li>
<li><em><strong><a href="https://github.com/"  rel="noopener">I learned about GitHub and GitBook</a>,</strong></em> a great tool for collaborative problem-solving on a global scale.</li>
<li><a href="https://wordpress.org/plugins/feedwordpress/"  rel="noopener"><em><strong>I installed a &#8220;Syndication&#8221; plugin</strong></em></a> which is already helping me identify everybody else in this course through my website.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qgqK-I3mHuM&amp;index=4&amp;list=PL29XoFF-jKFXwC4HlYAo7ug3prmhta3n2&amp;t=1427s"  rel="noopener"><em><strong>I followed the YouTube video &#8220;How to Start a WordPress Blog the RIGHT WAY&#8211;Beginner&#8217;s Guide (Step by Step)&#8221;</strong> </em></a>to get help in downloading media to use in my posts, and in formatting the posts so they would catch the reader&#8217;s interest.</li>
</ul>

<em>By the way, in case you haven&#8217;t already noticed, the above links all &#8220;open in a new tab&#8221; so you won&#8217;t lose this page when checking them out.</em>

This was, for me, time well spent. I&#8217;m already slightly less intimidated than when I started this course. Thanks again, Colin!
