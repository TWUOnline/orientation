Completing this assignment today was quite the learning experience.

I discovered quite quickly that I find it difficult to assess myself beyond the experiences of the day.  I had an awful day, and one specific moment in which I did not respond well.  I know that moment doesn&#8217;t define me, and is not typical of my behaviour, but I struggled to rate myself above that regrettable action.

I learned that those closest to me know me best, and I cannot wear masks with them.  Co-workers rated me high on self-confidence and self-assurance; relatives and friends rated me lower.  Which tells me that I am a good actress.  I am not sure yet if this is a good quality, or not so good.

I also learned that my self-assessment is congruent with others on the traits that relate to my internal drivers, but there were discrepancies on the more relational traits (empathic, friendly, etc).  Though I am not happy that others rated me lower on these, I am happy that I am now aware:  the truth about me will set me free. This journey of change will likely be difficult, but I am excited to set my foot out the door.
