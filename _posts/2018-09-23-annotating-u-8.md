The initial account creation and sign in to hypothes.is went pretty smoothly and I found myself ready to read the Manifesto.  Now up to this point in my life, I have not really had what you might call a strong online presence.  I do have social media accounts but my activity is sporadic at best.  As we become more familiar with tools like WordPress and hypothes.is I am gaining a new appreciation for the new modes of learning and communication that seem to be shaping the educational environment in which I find myself in.

As I read through the Manifesto and read the annotations of others I began to see the beauty of the community that was forming through people sharing their thoughts while others replied adding depth to the context of what we were reading.  While I will always value the sense of fulfilment that I get from face to face contact, I know that great community can also be established through various forms of connection.

I often hear others talking about how young people today do not know what real community means, but they may just be experiencing community in new ways.
