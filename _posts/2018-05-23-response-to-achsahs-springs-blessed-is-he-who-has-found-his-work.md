Once again, I loved reading your post! Thank you for sharing your story and how sometimes the path we start out on isn’t the one we eventually end up on. I think it is important for us to reassure our children and graduating students that not only is it okay to change direction from time to time, it is all a part of our journey to find our true calling. A lot of my Grade 12’s genuinely have no idea what it is they want to do, not because they are unmotivated, there are just so many opportunities available they have a fear of “settling” or missing out on something even better. This fear of the unknown causes great anxiety and can even be crippling at times.

I love my job, without a doubt, it is my life’s vocation, my calling. Even when I factor in the really tough days, there is no place that I would rather be. Your questions are so relevant and we all need reminders that our work really is a blessing.   What do you think we could do to help others who are feeling disillusioned and bitter about their work, realize what a blessing it really is?

Thank you for all that you do to help others. It is inspiring to me!
