<p>&#8216;How are we becoming better photographers&#8217; &#8211; It was a quick photography 101 for me  !</p>
<p>I tried the techniques  &#8216; show me the light&#8217; , &#8216; great foreground on a great back ground &#8216; and &#8216;better contrast .. &#8216;</p>
<p>I also tried to compose a picture in my mind before I captured it &#8211; he kinda obliged , not entirely though !</p>
<p>I wanted to place him in the middle of the halo from the overhead light . His white and lightbrown coat contrasts amazingly with the dark brown floor .</p>
