I hadn&#8217;t ever heard of trackers so this exercise was informative. I liked the visual graph that Lightbeam provides. I thought that only the website I visited kept data, not that third party websites also collected data! Overall, I visited 14 websites on my work computer since September 19, but in reality was tracked by 143 other websites! The website with the most trackers was PrintAction.com, a graphic arts industry website. After reading about trackers, this made sense given that the PrintAction website has a lot of advertising, which would be tracking what I do. I use Google Chrome and it is set to keep cookies from third parties for one week.
