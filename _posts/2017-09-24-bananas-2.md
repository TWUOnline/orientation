<p>Considering the term and hashtag #FAKENEWS didn&#8217;t really exist a year ago I certainly believe we now live in a world where people are starting to ask questions about our news sources and their legitimacy in bringing us correct information.</p>
<p>Ironically, I live by the premis that I will always trust a person until they give me a reason not to. However, when it comes to articles like the one about bananas shared in this task I think I am the opposite. I will assume it is not true until I gather enough evidence from news and social media sources. I then weigh things up on my imaginary scales and if more articles and news appears to back an argument then I will believe it.</p>
<p>Alarm bells that rang for me in the bananas article included:</p>
<ul>
<li>The article began with &#8220;Warning&#8221;</li>
<li>The amount of &#8230;&#8217;s</li>
<li>No actual author or quote from a person.</li>
<li>Why only bananas? Article says any fruit from Costa Rica could me infected.</li>
</ul>
<p>All this talk of bananas has got me hungry!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com/467/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com/467/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=67148074&%23038;post=467&%23038;subd=mrwilliamsphysed&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
