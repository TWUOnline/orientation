<p>What happened to Justine Sacco and others in the article is an absolute horror and reminds me of how permanent things you put on the internet can be.  Anyone can be a critic and even close friendships can be affected due to social media.  I am blessed that I have not experienced it, but I have seen this happen to other people on Facebook.  Taking a lesson from what I just read, I will not go into details.  In short, someone posted their opinion on Facebook and a heated debate ensued online ending with threats to unfriend and to no longer speak to each other again.</p>
<p>Although I have a Facebook account, I do not post nor write comments that often.  I am very careful with what I post online.  Work requires me to be a bit more active so I take a lot of time crafting what I write/post.  I tend to read and reread.  I find myself being very critical of my own wording and the tone I set.</p>
