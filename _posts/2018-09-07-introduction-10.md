Hello, everyone!

I feel great<img class="wp-image-16 alignleft" src="http://create.twu.ca/papagena163/files/2018/09/Hasegawa_Hiromi-219x300.jpg" alt="" width="165" height="226" srcset="https://create.twu.ca/papagena163/files/2018/09/Hasegawa_Hiromi-219x300.jpg 219w, https://create.twu.ca/papagena163/files/2018/09/Hasegawa_Hiromi-768x1051.jpg 768w, https://create.twu.ca/papagena163/files/2018/09/Hasegawa_Hiromi-748x1024.jpg 748w" sizes="(max-width: 165px) 100vw, 165px" /> and a little nervous to be connected in this way because this is my first experience to write a blog.

My Name is Hiromi.<br />
I am from Japan and had worked as a plastic surgeon for 15 years when I lived in Japan.<br />
Throughout my career, while my main role was that of a clinician, I was also promoted to become more directly involved with the hospital management teams and with various personnel affairs.<br />
This role has reinforced my interest in studying how best to become a good team leader. The number of physicians and general medical staff members are chronically insufficient in many parts of Japan. Therefore, great leadership and management skills are essential to organize and maximize the efficiency and effectiveness of these limited teams to work to their greatest potential.

4 years ago, I take sabbatical leave from my work and moved to Canada with my three children to enhance and expand their education experience in the assurance that they would learn more about different cultures outside Japan and also for myself. Also, it was my choice to focus on the care and upbringing our three children which afforded me the opportunity to work at home with them, while my husband keeps working in Japan. As our children have settled well into their school-life here in Canada, I have found myself with more free time. Therefore, I began to think that I would make better use of my free time to enhance my medical career by going back to the higher education school system.

I am excited with my new journey and look forward to meeting you!
