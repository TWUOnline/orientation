<p>For my sound effect story, I created a short clip of a baby being woken up from a nap by a telephone ringing. Being 30 weeks pregnant, I&#8217;ve got babies on my mind! I imagine this will be a situation that I will face in the near future. Or maybe not&#8230;I won&#8217;t be so careless to take my cell phone off silent mode!</p>
<p>I found Audacity to be quite user friendly. It only took me a few minutes to figure out how to trim, silent, and move the timing of the different audio clips around. However, I did not use any of the special fade in/fade out effects this time because I felt like my audio clips blended well enough without the effects. In total, I used 4 different audio clips.</p>
<p>Next time, I would like to explore &#8220;stacking&#8221; more than one audio clip at a time. Since it was my first experience with audio editing on Audacity, I stuck to a simple single audio sound at a time for this track. I would like to explore using different background and ambiance sounds next time.</p>
<p>I got all my audio clips from <a href="http://soundbible.com/free-sound-effects-1.html">SoundBible</a>. I was surprised at how many sound effects were available and how easy they were to download and use!</p>
<p>Last but not least, here is my audio track!</p>
