<p>Oh to have a common name! I have always found the genericness of Tom Williams to be a blessing as well as at times a curse! As far as names go it seems common. But I have always been a fan of having a name that is strong, bold and useable in a job interview.</p>
<p>So what I have I found out about myself in my time of searching? Well firstly, as I write this I am listening to myself on Spotify &#8230; well not myself but you know what I mean! I am impressed, If I were to give myself a genre as a musician it would probably be the folky/ alternative rendition of music I am listening to on this fine Sunday afternoon.</p>
<p>I did find myself on the first page of a google search which I was quite pleased with. I had an interview with a national newspaper in the UK a few years ago trying to build support for a national girls rugby competition. Other than that nothing incriminating I am afraid. It appears the genericness of my name, as well as the privacy settings and personal way of managing my social media profiles, is working.</p>
<p>Facebook = Personal</p>
<p>Instagram = Personal</p>
<p>Twitter = Professional</p>
<p>LinkedIn = Professional</p>
<p>Below is the only photo I found &#8230; a proud mug shot from my conference workshop appearance at the Asia Pacific Physical Education Conference. (APPEC).</p>
