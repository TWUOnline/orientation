There are many people who come to mind who exude transformational leadership qualities. Individuals like Winston Churchill who through his clear vision and his famous speech entitled &#8220;We Shall Never Surrender&#8221; (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CyoMp2JceOw"  rel="noopener">video clip of speech here</a>) brought a country together to inspire people to accomplish more than they originally thought possible.

Bill Gates, Microsoft inventor, who not only created opportunities for his employees to be innovative and grow, he also built trust with his followers and modelled philanthropy through the creation of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.

I cannot even begin to compare to the individuals listed above and their accomplishments, however, on a much smaller scale, the chapter on Transformational Leadership (Northouse, 2019), is essentially describing my vocation. Transformational leaders &#8220;may be especially effective in environments where followers need to focus on learning, development, and mastering job related tasks&#8221; (Northouse, p.173).

I would like to share the following examples that I incorporate into my teaching practice as a transformational leader.

<strong>Teaching and the 4 I&#8217;s  &amp; Kouzes and Posner&#8217;s Five Fundamental Practices as referred to by Northouse (2019, pp 169-171 and pp 176-177):</strong>

<strong>Idealized Influence:</strong>  As a teacher, I try really hard to act as a &#8220;strong role model&#8221; for students and to ensure that my students know that I have &#8220;high standards of moral and ethical conduct and can be counted on to do the right thing&#8221;(Northouse, p.169). I also know that genuine respect is earned with students, and I do my best to gain their trust. This trust and respect is a two way street. It is important to recognize that transformational leadership is dually shared by both leader and follower. &#8220;Transformational leadership is not the sole responsibility of a leader, but rather emerges from the interplay between leaders and followers&#8221; (Northouse, p.179).

<strong>Inspirational Motivation/Model the Way/Inspire a Shared Vision:</strong> I have high expectations for <strong><em>all</em> </strong>of my students and communicate this clearly, failure is <strong><em>not</em></strong> an option.  Transformational leadership &#8220;moves followers to accomplish more than what is usually expected of them&#8221; (Northouse, p. 172). This applies personally,  socially and academically. I provide my students with a clear <strong>vision</strong> of the future state of our classroom. Sharing this vision really is &#8220;simple, understandable, beneficial and energy creating&#8221; (p.175). Students genuinely support the vision because it helps them feel empowered &#8220;because they feel they are a significant dimension of a worthwhile enterprise&#8221; (Bennis &amp; Nanus, 2007, pp. 90-91).  I tell my students that we are like a family when we are together and because of that, we need to look out for each other and for those who we might not know <em>yet</em> but who attend our school.  Students really do become &#8220;motivated to transcend their own self-interests for the good of the group&#8221; (Northouse, p. 172).

<strong>Intellectual Stimulation/Challenge The Process:</strong> As part of the curriculum expectations, I try to provide opportunities for students to be &#8220;creative, innovative and to challenge their own beliefs and values&#8221; (Northouse, p.171). It is essential that I promote both critical and creative thinking skills so that students can learn how to think for themselves and be successful problem solvers.  We want our students to be &#8220;willing to innovate, grow, and improve&#8221; and &#8220;to take risks and learn from their mistakes to make things better&#8221;. (Northouse, p. 176). One way in particular that teachers have the biggest impact on their students is when they provide real life, authentic challenges. Students accomplish more and are intrinsically motivated when they find meaning in their work. Mohammed, Fernado, &amp; Caputi, 2013 as quoted by Northouse (2019) state, &#8220;Transformational leaders are most likely to have a positive impact on followers when followers identify with or find meaning in their work&#8221; (p.172).

<strong>Individualized Consideration/Enable Others to Act/Encourage the Heart:</strong> I provide a &#8220;supportive climate&#8221; and &#8220;listen carefully&#8221; to the needs of my students (Northouse, p.171). I am not just an academic teacher, I also take on the role of life advisor, coach, cheerleader, counsellor depending upon the need. I &#8220;build trust with others and promote collaboration,&#8221; as well as &#8220;listen closely to diverse points of view, treating others with dignity and respect&#8221; (Northouse, p.177). My role doesn&#8217;t end after my lesson is taught, but rather, I spend time &#8220;treating each student in a caring and unique way&#8221; as I try to assist my students in becoming &#8220;fully actualized&#8221; (Northouse, p.171).  To some students, I give &#8220;strong affiliation&#8221; as they are self-starters, to others, I may give &#8220;specific directives with a high degree of structure&#8221; (p.171).  As a transformational leader, I try to &#8220;create an environment where people can feel good about their work and how it contributes to the greater community&#8221; (p.177).  I provide &#8220;praise for jobs well done&#8221; and am very &#8220;attentive to this need&#8221; through the use of &#8220;authentic celebrations&#8221; to &#8220;show appreciation and encouragement to others&#8221; (p.177).

In summary, transformational leadership focuses on inspiring followers to &#8220;accomplish great things by focusing on building trust, understanding and adapting to the needs and motives of followers&#8221; (Northouse, p.192).

Do you agree with MLQ questionnaire as being a valid and reliable indicator of effective Transformational Leadership?
