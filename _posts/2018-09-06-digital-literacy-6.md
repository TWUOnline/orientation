In the context of the available standard digital tools within the &#8220;brick and mortar&#8221; business world, I would consider myself to be a respectful, conscientious and digitally literate participant when communicating my ideas and thoughts with others. However, in light of the rapid proliferation of social media engines, I sense that the basic digital platforms such as e-mail, Scopia, webinar and GoToMeetings which I have become so familiar with, have limited ranges within the broader scope of &#8220;Digital Literacy&#8221;.

I participate digitally through Twitter and LinkedIn as a means to stay connected to my peer and industry groups, albeit on an inconsistent and passive basis. Primarily I use Twitter for business feeds showcasing industry information and LinkedIn in order to maintain relevancy and a professional profile exposure alongside everyone else; therefore, my only experience witnessing consequences and negative fallout upon others has been through public posts from popular and not-so popular national leaders. As an extension to this question, I have only witnessed public shaming through press or media agencies and have never experienced public shaming in life, or in business as a result of irresponsible or inappropriate comments said online.

In life, I have learned that &#8220;winging-it&#8221;, or any such approach with an air of impulsiveness can often lead to disaster: therefore, I have three good rules to avoid inadvertently revealing any latent character flaws:

1) Urges to pen &#8220;Manifesto&#8221; type statements should be slept-on first.

2) If you forward others&#8217; posts &#8211; you might as be the original author.

3) What would your mother say about your statement?

Fairly basic. Those that share my faith would also agree that we are held to a higher standard and one of perfection; therefore, let us remember our fallen nature, our less than attractive desires and forgiveness of those in which we could easily be occupying the same shoes.

Matt
