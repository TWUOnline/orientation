I have to admit that I have previously been duped by false information in two different settings.  In both cases it would have been great to fact check.  The first occurred early on in my teaching career.  I don&#8217;t even recall the topic now, but I was in the middle of sharing some information with a science class and a student put up their hand.  &#8220;Mr. Morrow, I watched <em>Myth Busters</em> recently and they said that idea is not true.&#8221;  Whether the fact was right or not, I learned to be more careful.  The second instance occurred early in my tenure as a facebook user.  There was a post that came across the feed explaining that an actor or singer (I don&#8217;t remember) had passed away.  As I felt a loss at this news, I quickly shared it on my own page.  It didn&#8217;t take long for me to hear back from my followers that the information was incorrect.

I appreciate the concept of Mike&#8217;s <em>four moves and a habit</em>.  I feel that I have become more careful because of my previous experiences, <em>four moves</em> provides a tool to protect myself further.  I tried a couple of Mike&#8217;s challenges.  It was great to learn that it takes little time and only a few moves to determine the truth of much of the information that is available online.
