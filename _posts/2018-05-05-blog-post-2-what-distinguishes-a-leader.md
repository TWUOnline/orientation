According to northouse pg8 &#8220;Some people are leaders because of their formal position in an organization, whereas others are leaders because of the way other group members respond<br />
to them. These two common forms of leadership are called assigned leadership<br />
and emergent leadership&#8221;.

Assigned leaders are those who are given a particular position to hold and given powers to attain a particular goal by assigning workers to let them work, these leaders are sometimes, not chosen by their workers rather is chosen by the some exams or by someone else who might be the honor of the organisation like : administrator, team leaders, plant managers etc (northouse pg8) but they are not the true leader in themselves, they sometimes may be held responsible for exploitation of the workers and making them do work against their will, however emergent leader is one chosen by the people to lead them, they are more influential and is himself get involved in helping co-workers, these leaders actually know what it takes to be a leader and knows how to properly lead  a group of people which do not even affect them and their emotions. There is another reference from nothrouse pg8 which took my breath and I found it the most apt words for differentiation between assigned and emergent leader &#8220;<em><span style="color: #0000ff">the person assigned to a leadership position does not always become the real leader in a particular setting. When others perceive an individual as the most influential member of a group or an organization, regardless of the </span></em><em><span style="color: #0000ff">individual’s title, the person is exhibiting emergent leadership&#8221;</span></em>

A few months back during my bachelor&#8217;s in college days I found myself as an emergent leader when we (our batch) organised an event in which everyone is assigned a particular duties but being so, excited and enthusiastic I worked for other duties too due to which other people in the group found my ideas and philosophies of doing work more effectively was appreciated by them and they started following me and started working according to me and by asking me which led to a successful event organisation and hence, I found myself as an emergent leader.

<em><span style="color: #ff0000"> The primary functions of management, as first identified by Fayol (1916), were planning, organizing,  staffing, and controlling. These functions are still representative of the field of management</span></em><br />
<em><span style="color: #ff0000">today. </span></em><span style="color: #ff0000"><span style="color: #000000">and <span style="color: #993300">according to kotter (1990) &#8220;leadership is about seeking adaptive and constructive<br />
change&#8221;. <span style="color: #000000">(northouse pg13). These are the two references which I found most apt to differentiate between the two. However, these are closely related to each other yet is very different form each other, the managers are responsible for letting the people do work and make them do the things right and in an effective manner, for example a manager of an hotel do not do all the work by himself rather led the people to do so, guide them, assigned them their work, plan all the steps in which a work is being performed through proper organisation and also held responsible for controlling them to attain the goal in the minimum possible time and used to keep a check over all the departments. However, leader  is the one who usually change according to the will of people, can also be involved with them during the work but however, the two both are generally co linked with each other and if one of the two is not doing effectively it leads to the failure of other and  of the whole organisation. so, these two are like a relationship in which one holds the hand of others and is responsible to run it effectively.                                <img class="" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1494850745083-7307f62b460c?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjM1Nzl9&amp;s=d1ad6088d44b422e75cbc7dbee6fde27" width="175" height="111" /></span></span></span></span>

For an organisation to be successful one should always and effective everyone should work as a team and with each other and to attain a particular goal to achieve so that it can lead to a successful organisation. Managers hold their duties to assign other&#8217;s duties and taking care of things , workers should always follow their leaders whom they choose by not arguing and without any delay and leaders should always be an helping hand for workers which gives them huge courage and will and everyone works with a passion  to attain a particular goal, by this way an organisation can run in the best possible way.                                                        <img class="" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1455849318743-b2233052fcff?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjM1Nzl9&amp;s=a875e0591c850ffb8ea04b0dbf6030ca" width="271" height="181" />

Do you really think it is necessary for a manager to always use their power even if it i against the will of workers to attain a particular goal in the least possible time <img class="" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1458419948946-19fb2cc296af?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjM1Nzl9&amp;s=c31131c829aea7b5d8c02ec1a59af845" width="94" height="63" />
