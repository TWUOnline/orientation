It's Monday morning here in Langley, and I trust you are doing well having hopefully recovered from the abomination that is the switch to Daylight Savings Time.

I have thoroughly enjoyed reading your posts in response to this week's activities. It seems that hypothes.is is a tool that has resonated with many of you, and for good reason! There are some significant advantages to having students annotate <em>in situ</em> on the web.

There are, as you might imagine, people who have concerns about hypothes.is. <a href="http://hackeducation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audrey Watters is one of the most important voices in educational technology right now</a> and <a href="http://hackeducation.com/2017/04/26/no-annotations-thanks-bye" target="_blank" rel="noopener">she recently blocked annotation tools on her sites</a>. For Audrey, who, as a woman in edtech, disabled comments on her site as a result of receiving countless threats of violence, disabling comments was a matter of her being able to preserve her own wellness, and for people to get around that desire by using hypothes.is to comment on her work <em>in situ, </em>was enough for her to actively take steps to block those tools.

One thing that I hope you will take from this course is that 'technology' will not ever 'fix' education. There are certainly good things enabled by technology when it is used well, but technology in general, and educational technology in particular, does not exist in a moral vacuum.

It matters which tools you use.

It matters what your students are doing online.

It matters whether or not your students can control their privacy and data.

On a related note, you likely have some comments on your own site waiting for approval. In your dashboard, click 'Comments' to see what is going on there. You may have some that are spam, but you also likely have some that are either pingbacks from my previous post, or actual comments from your colleagues...or if you are like me, your mother-in-law. It is a good idea to check that regularly and clean out the spam.

Alternately, and this is what I have done with my own blog, you can disallow comments altogether by going to 'Settings' &gt; 'Discussion' in your dashboard and refining the settings there.
