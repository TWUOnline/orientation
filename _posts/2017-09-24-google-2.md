<p>That was a fascinating hour of my life! I have always had background knowledge of the way google influences society, and how much data they have about me. However, I certainly felt the penny drop hard in my head this time! Last year at a spring production at our school our middle schoolers displayed a fascinating portrayal of how technology has impacted the world. One of the students who represented google somewhat comically shared personal information about someone else on the stage who was horrified how google had gained that information.</p>
<p>My google searches certainly displayed some strong almost archaic stereotypes. I mean I know I am a PE teacher &#8230; but who honestly has a chalkboard anymore? Apparently every professor and teacher according to google. Apparently, to be an effective leader folks we need to become cartoon-like characters who lead from the front always!</p>
<p>Finding some new google search hacks was certainly the highlight of this task. I have produced my own little cheat sheet now. I must admit I feel a little bit ashamed to admit I share the tendencyÂ of Alan November&#8217;s students &#8230; one search, first page results. Hopefully, this whole new world of deeper diving into my google searches will produce some deeper pearls of wisdom.</p>
