Dr. Christian Klaue is currently the principal of <a href="http://www.saskatoonchristianschool.ca/about-us/leadership.cfm">Saskatoon Christian School</a> and has been principal of Campbell River Christian School and <a href="http://www.wlmcs.org/about.html">Maranatha Christian School</a> before that. He is currently married to Joy and has four children who are either in university or have graduated. His second oldest daughter is married.

Dr. Klaue is a conference speaker apart from his work in education. He was the featured speaker for <a href="http://www.compasscall.ca/">Compass Call</a> for two different conferences:

and

He is also an active itinerant preacher, notably at <a href="http://www.elimgospelchapel.com/sermons.html">Elim Gospel Chapel</a> and <a href="https://www.clfcr.com/media?page=3&amp;speaker=0">Christian Life Assembly</a>, where he has preached on Genesis and Christian Education.

Dr. Klaue has also maintained a <a href="https://christianklaue1.wordpress.com/2018/03/05/thoughts-on-immooc-intro/">personal blog</a> as well as a blog at <a href="https://principalspondering.wordpress.com/about/">Saskatoon Christian School</a> where he writes on topics relating to education and Christianity and the intersection and/or integration between them. One of his blog topics is the importance of being and becoming a steward and what that means. He has also written about books he has recently read.

Finally, Dr. Klaue is active on two social media platforms: Twitter and Instagram and also maintains an identity on LinkedIn. On his Twitter account he usually forwards articles on education-related topics such as boys in education, as well as the subject areas of Social Studies, Science, and English. His other tweets are often responses to statements made by people he follows on Twitter. He has minimal personal references on Twitter. Dr. Klaue&#8217;s <a href="https://www.instagram.com/docklaue/">Instagram</a> all have nature as a theme. There are two personal photographs; other than that, just nature scenes with descriptions of when and where they were taken.

The various bits of information found through the searches indicate that Dr. Klaue is interested in family, education, theology, and nature. Listening in on Dr. Klaue&#8217;s sermons indicate that he enjoys both topical (Christian Education) as well as expository (Genesis and Ephesians) preaching. Looking at the various blog posts and photos supplied indicate that Dr. Klaue finished his Ed.D recently and also enjoys fishing as a hobby. Judging by the photos, catching salmon on the West Coast is his primary focus. What is interesting to note is that, apart from a brief biography found on Compass Call, there is very little mention of his family or of their activities and interests. It almost seems as if Dr. Klaue wants to keep his family life out of the public&#8217;s eye.

Considering Bonnie Stewart&#8217;s <a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com/2012/05/06/digital-identities-six-key-selves/">Digital Identities: Six Key Selves of Networked Publics</a>, there several identities that Dr. Klaue seems to follow. First, Dr. Klaue is aware that he has a public self. He is found on several platforms, but not many. Most of his mentions are on school or church websites with the exceptions of his social media accounts. In all of his mentions, there is very little relating to his family. That shows an understanding of his accounts being public.

Dr. Klaue is also has an articulated self. He has views on his blogs and followers on his Twitter and Instagram accounts, but not many. Dr. Klaue also follows a number of his followers both on Twitter and Instagram. The lack of followers leads one to question just how important connection is to him. Some social media users have thousands (or more) followers and their presence can easily be quantified. This lack may indicate that his presence is more of a way for Dr. Klaue to reach out than to be completely connected.

That Dr. Klaue participates on the internet can be seen by his Twitter posts and even many of his blog posts. He often engages in a Twitter conversation about various educational topics and also responds to others&#8217; own blog posts. Some of these comments are shared in general; others are just a comment on someone else&#8217;s blog without making the comment more visible to others.

Finally, it is interesting to note how few mentions of Dr. Klaue there are. Most of the mentions are about him rather than by him. The information that is available by Dr. Klaue is almost entirely around his production: blog posts, tweets, and Instagram photos. This indicates that Dr. Klaue is most likely aware of his brand and seeks to augment it rather than dilute it.

What was interesting to note is that there is another Christian Klaue who is much more famous. The other Mr. Klaue is the head of the German Olympic Committee and has wide connections on social media and news sites. He is active on Facebook, Twitter, and Youtube. He is also referenced on a number of news sites, particularly around sports and his involvement with the Olympics.

Censorship?

I am always aware of the need for online censorship. I am very cautious as to the kind of information I post. I try to keep away from politics, although that does not always happen, and I try to make sure I respond in such a way that I will not be embarrassed later on if I read it again. The one issue that I have not yet sufficiently grappled with is removing or altering content at a later date if my thinking on the subject has changed. I have chronicled several changes in thinking through my blog, but I have not paid as much attention to my Twitter account as I have to my blog. I still am very careful with Twitter, but I have not reviewed old tweets. That is something I should probably start doing.

This reminds me of <a href="https://pushpullfork.com/tag/digital-minimalism/">Kris Shaffer&#8217;s posts on digital minimalism</a>. I, too, prefer minimalism (at least on the internet). I actively tweet, but my volume may only be 5-10 posts weekly. I also blog and have made a commitment to at least blog weekly on my school blog. I have sometimes gone years without writing a new post on my personal blog. I have not yet deleted any of my blog posts, although I have reviewed them and even used some of them as a springboard for new blog posts. I also add photos to my Instagram account, but there are times when I do not add a photo for weeks. When I travel and take photos that I know I want to post, I will often wait months before posting them so that others won&#8217;t be able to connect that photo with my current location. The one area where I can see myself wanting to reduce my presence is in relation to my Twitter account. Even though I have virtually no personal information on it, and use it primarily as a connection tool for my role as an educator, there are certainly tweets that are no longer applicable. I have tweeted a number of conferences and that is information I can easily discard now.
