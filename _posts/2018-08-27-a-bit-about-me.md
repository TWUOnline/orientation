Hi! My name is Brittni. To be honest, I&#8217;m a bit nervous about going back to school. It&#8217;s been several years since I was in college.

I currently work full time with YWAM in Vancouver leading our Youth Department. We run short term urban outreaches for youth groups, as well as an 8 day camp-style urban discipleship program for teens. I LOVE what I do! I&#8217;ve been in full time ministry for almost 6 years and felt like it was time for a bit of a change of gears. I am taking a year sabbatical from ministry in order to pursue the Master of Arts in Leadership full time. My sabbatical doesn&#8217;t start until 2019, but I am starting my first course this fall to give myself time to adjust.

Not only did I feel it was time for a change in gears, but I want to continue to improve myself. I believe that good leaders never stop growing. I felt that the best way for me to grow in my leadership abilities at this point in my life is to pursue formal education. This brought me to pursue the Master of Arts in Leadership.

I&#8217;m excited to be learning with you!
