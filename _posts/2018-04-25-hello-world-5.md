Good morning everyone,

This is my first time I have traveled to Canada for my course with Trinity Western University, till now it is an amazing experience to be here.

A few days back I attended a general meeting with twu staff and current students, it was so much encouraging and I feel so much comfort after looking at so many people who are very helping and is ready to answer even to my silly questions.

Looking forward to start my first course that is LDRS 500 in just a few days.
