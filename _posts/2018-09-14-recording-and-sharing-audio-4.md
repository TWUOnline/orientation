Learning to record and embed files was a useful thing to learn especially in today&#8217;s day and age. I found it really interesting to check out SoundCloud since I hear a lot of people use the website. I found that Anchor was extremely easy to use because I just recorded a voice clip and then downloaded it onto my desktop. However, I couldn&#8217;t figure out how to record with SoundCloud, so I uploaded my Anchor recording and then easily embedded it into this post (by copy pasting the provided link).

I am confident that understanding this process will contribute significantly to my online learning throughout the MA of Leadership.
