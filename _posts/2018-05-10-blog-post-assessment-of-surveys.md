Approach towards leadership is one of the most important aspect for a leader to pursue leadership in an organisation, according to northouse the three basic approach as explained was behavioral, skill, and situational approaches which defines a leader, and ability to do his job with perfection.

These surveys are based on such approaches to evaluate us, after completing this survey I found a lot of pros. And cons.  about me regarding leadership, I’m able to know in which area I need to buckle up and work hard in those areas. The overall results conclude that I need to do a lot with my relationship behavioral approach scoring just 35, however with task behavioral approach I achieve 46 out of 50 which is not bad and falls in very high range category. The skill approach which compares three fields:- technical, human and conceptual skill approach which makes me realize that I have less conceptual skill with a score of only 22 however, the other two is much far better for me and I found myself struggling with dependable, outgoing and sensitive personality characteristics with a lesser score.

Yes, they align with my self conception because in my inner side I know in which fields I have to work to be a better leader and these surveys even describes it and also make me confirm about which other fields are required for me to look upon. I would like to consider about how a leader is gonna act if given certain situations which can tell about the decision making ability and efficiency of the leader and to make him prepare for future situations                 <img class="" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1508700115892-45ecd05ae2ad?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjM1Nzl9&amp;s=47a1f128db5741e281e4124d2f01adc2" width="333" height="222" />

The only thing that I felt challenges me is the conceptual skills score which I found too low for me, I never thought of this as I always find myself with great ideas and conceptual thoughts but after this survey I get to know that this is not enough and have to be more conceptual in approach towards work. so, as to be at the top of the sky to achieve higher in life.
