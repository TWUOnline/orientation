<p>I created my word press site back in December and have not adjusted much since that time.  I will do my best to describe the choices that I made and why I made them here in this post.</p>
<p>Word press was a new platform for me when I created my site back in December.  I created my site for the purpose of teaching the MA Lead online cohort LDRS 591 (Scholarly Inquiry).  I watched all of the videos on pages versus posts, organizing content, menus, and being a scholar in public.  After watching these videos I decided that I wanted my site to be professional, with an accent of the personal.</p>
<p>I chose the elegant theme for my site because I like the way that it looked and I like how it presented information.  I was able to change my &#8220;tagline&#8221; to include a quote that is personally very important to me.</p>
<p>On my site, I decided to create two pages &#8211; one that describes who I am &#8211; one that describes my favorite leadership and spiritual development resources. I did this so that the learners in my class could find information about me.  I provided information in biographical form, highlighting only key points.  I suppose in the future I could add my CV, a list of my publications and also research interests.</p>
<p>Some of the challenges that I have encountered are related to uploading audio files and video files and power point presentations to share on my blog. I figured out how to upload media content (pictures, PDF&#8217;s, etc.) however, if the file was too large then word press would not let me upload the file.  I have found other ways to &#8220;upload&#8221; the content of these files via links where the information is hosted on other sites such as dropbox, youtube, or soundcloud.  This has been an interesting learning curve.</p>
<p>I have also used a picture as my header that I found on <a href="https://unsplash.com/">unsplash.com</a>. I like this picture because it is of a person overlooking a mountain range.  I live in the mountains and have spent a good deal of time hiking.  What I have noticed about mountains is that they are not easy to climb!  In my mind a mountain symbolizes working hard, overcoming obstacles, and rising strong despite the challenges in front of you. It takes great effort to climb a mountain and you almost always encounter obstacles in your path (e.g., dehydration, fatigue, bears!!) and more often then not, you can&#8217;t see where you are going. When you do make it to the top, you experience a great sense of accomplishment at the new skills (e.g., perseverance, courage, strength) that you have learned and the new perspective that you are taking in.  This new perspective changes the way you see yourself and the world around you.</p>
<p>I think what this picture symbolizes is true in life and in leadership.  When we are faced with challenges (e.g., conflict, change, uncertainty), we need to learn new skills (e.g., perseverance, courage, strength and faith) to overcome the obstacles in front of us.  Part of overcoming includes change the way we are seeing those obstacles &#8212; to see each obstacle as an opportunity for growth and not a threat.  When we use these newly acquired skills to accomplish goals, then the result is gaining a new perspective.  This new perspective can help us move into the next stage in our journey with confidence, strength and wisdom.</p>
<p>As of right now, I am happy with my site.  Like I said earlier, I may post my CV and some links to my publications, create a research page and perhaps start blogging about topics that I am passionate about in the future.  The possibilities are endless!</p>
