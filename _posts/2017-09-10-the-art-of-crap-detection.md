<p>We are constantly overwhelmed by information, both fictitious and factual. The internet is a hub of fear mongering, social shaming, trolling, and cynicism. We the masses have to wade through the news with a fine tooth comb to be able to pick out the shreds of truth through all of the biased spin. In a world of &#8220;fake news&#8221; new need to be as wise as serpents and as harmless as doves (Matthew 10:16).</p>
<p>I do believe the world has become very cynical and skeptical of what is sent out in emails. Even if the banana story had been true, very few people would have done anything about it. In fact, when people see the hysteria on the news, they often chose to ignore it. The trouble arises not in the reaction to the story but in the de-sensitivity of the masses and the lack of ability to find truth in all of the babble.</p>
