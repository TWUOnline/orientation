The above bio reflects the limited information that I found about myself online.  When I searched for myself online using google, yahoo, bing, and duck-duck go, the first thing I found was a young hair stylist with a twitter handle of @jamiegarlandhair.   I also found someone with the same name who is involved in the editorial department of the movie industry.  I learned that there are many people with the name Jamie Garland who have much more written about them than I do.  Some of them are very talented musicians or athletes or quite popular on social media.  It was an interesting exercise.  The first search result that related to me was a link to our staff page at my workplace.  The only other search result that pointed to me was from LinkedIn, which is where the above picture is from.

Because I share a Facebook account with my wife my profile did not appear in any of the searches I conducted.  I am not surprised at my lack of presence online as I haven&#8217;t invested any time or effort into building a public profile.  I have practised self-censorship on sites like FB as I want to be very careful about what I post for everyone to see, as Kris Shaffer mentioned I want people to the information that I deliberately post online.  Because of my digital minimalism, I&#8217;m not sure if I can easily recognize any of the &#8216;selves&#8217; that Bonnie discusses in her article.  I&#8217;ll have to consider how I may or may not want to improve my online identity.
