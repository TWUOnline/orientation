So far this has been very eye opening. I&#8217;ve had Lightbeam running for about 15 minutes and have visited a few of my favorite sites. I visited 9 sites and I connected with 50 third party sites. It seems like the sites with more connections were online shopping sites. Where as sites that I used for work (that required a few different logins and securities) had less connections.

It will be interesting to follow Lightbeam throughout the week as I use my computer. This has made me much more aware of information sharing.
