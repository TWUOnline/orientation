Activity 1

During this activity the results I found where in line, for the most part, with what I expected.  Each category that I searched displayed results that favoured society stereotypes, with the predominant ethnicity representing the causcaian race within our geographical region.  The male gender preferences were evident in the professor and doctor professions and women in the teacher occupation.  Interestingly, the profession of nursing yielded a mix of women and men, which was enlightening because of the history of nursing being a female dominated occupation.  What I also found that wasn’t surprising, was when I searched leader, less pictures of actual people appeared and images that represent people instead. These images were displayed in a context where the figures of people representing a leader were ‘standing out’ from the group or crowd, or standing alone in a power position, on top of a mountain or above others .  This could reveal a stereotypical perception of how society views what a leader is; someone who leads a group of followers or leads in isolation, above others, for a greater cause.  It is just amazing to see how societal norms, perceptions and values are reflected so strongly in today’s technology.

Activity 2

I found this activity to be quite helpful in developing better internet searching and precisonary skills. The application of Roger Warner’s recommendations to improve accuracy and quality of search results suggested using the following, to guide my search;

I tried a few different tactics to gather results on this topic, but using all keywords with the “like” (+) symbol provided me with a few more leadership focused PDF options.

When searching for articles of interest related to my career, however, I was challenged. Although there are many pdf’s about nursing, many research articles require a subscription or to be puchased in order to be able to read the article in its entirety on line, for example Sage Journals.  Accessing a University library for peer reviewed and scholarly articles is, in my option, the most efficient way to gather and search for accurate information about the field of nursing.

Finding the podcast that represented my city’s home interests was probably the easiest search for me.  Again, by applying Warner’s suggestions, I just used the words podcast + Kimberley B.C and the result quickly  appeared was “A Night in Kimberley”, referring to our towns Junior hockey team podcast channel.
