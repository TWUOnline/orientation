<h3>Activity 1</h3>
<p>I found that for some of the search terms it was a very ethnic/gender search result. For example, when searching for &#8220;professor&#8221; the first several images were of caucasian men with white hair (some of which looked like Albert Einstein).<img class=" wp-image-35 alignleft" src="http://create.twu.ca/robtegelberg/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-10-at-3.35.56-PM-300x195.png" alt="" width="258" height="168" srcset="https://create.twu.ca/robtegelberg/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-10-at-3.35.56-PM-300x195.png 300w, https://create.twu.ca/robtegelberg/files/2017/09/Screen-Shot-2017-09-10-at-3.35.56-PM.png 565w" sizes="(max-width: 258px) 100vw, 258px" /></p>
<p>However, for some of the search results there were vary diverse gender/ethnicities. For example, when searching for teacher, every one of the first 15 pictures was a different gender/ethnicity than the picture before it.</p>

<p>There were both men and women of many different ethnicities. I found it interesting when searching for boy, most of the boys were between the ages of 5 and 10 and most were caucasian with brown hair. Most of the girls were between the ages of 10 and 15 and were caucasian with different hair colours. I am not sure why there is a difference in the age between boys and girls, but I found that unusual.</p>

<h3>Activity 2</h3>
<p>I have used several of the advanced google search techniques before. I often have my students search for png files using filetype: and I regularly search for teacher resources using filetype:pdf. When looking for scholarly articles I use google scholar. For instance, Leadership: Theory and Practice (7th Edition) by Peter Northouse is available <a href="https://books.google.ca/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=TuyeBgAAQBAJ&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=leadership+theory&amp;ots=myRHnHbL0h&amp;sig=t_-AJN1vfqpGQrl0nrgsGkHjzNI#v=onepage&amp;q=leadership%20theory&amp;f=false">here</a>Â and is required reading for our first assignment.</p>
