<h2>Using Audio Clips to Communicate</h2>
<h4>Anchor.Fm</h4>
<p>I first installed the anchor app, thinking it would be a recording app that would save audio files to my phone/ipad. I did not realize that they hosted all recordings on their server, and that anything recorded on my &#8220;station&#8221; is actually part of their intellectual property rights. Much like Facebook has the right to use any photos that you host on their network, Anchor.fm has the rights to any audio created through their software.</p>

<p>The following link is a <a href="https://anchor.fm/rob60?at=831040">link to my anchor station</a>, where I made my first recording.</p>
<h4>SoundCloud</h4>
<p>SoundCloud is just an audio hosting service, I could not find any audio recording software through their iOS app or their website.</p>
<h4>Garage Band</h4>
<p>I have used <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/ca/app/garageband/id408709785?mt=8">GarageBand</a> to create audio files in the past. It is an easy to use program with a lot of editing options, however, it does not host information to a server, so you are left with a media file that you will need to host on a site like SoundCloud in order to publish it.</p>
