I chose a very simple Main Menu with dropdown menus so that I can easily navigate my website to find the course and content that I am focusing on at any particular time. I chose to have all of my courses for this year in the drop down menu under TWU Courses. I feel that structuring my website like this keeps it organized.

In the past, I have built a couple of websites using WordPress so I am fairly familiar with the process. However, I did not use &#8216;Categories&#8217; so this wasÂ  challenging at times to figure out. I overcame this by reading articles and watching videos to learn how to create parent categories and sub categories.

I am grateful that this opportunity is pushing me to further fine-tune my knowledge and skill of WordPress, which is a valuable skill to have in our digital world.
