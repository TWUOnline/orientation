<p>Whenever I receive an email like this, my first reaction is to delete it because I generally mistrust emails that come from unknown sources. I do not give my personal or work email out easily so it is unusual for me to receive unsolicited emails like this.</p>
<p>This email seems sketchy to me because of the poor punctuation and poor referencing of sources. There are also some grammar mistakes and this detracts from it&#8217;s credibility. I suppose I could take the time to research the legitimacy of it&#8217;s claims but I generally would not spend the time to do so. There is no proof in this email that the information actually came from the Center for Disease Control so I would need to confirm this information by researching the Manheim Research Institute and if this organization is legitimate, going one step further and researching the actual claims about the bananas. A quick google search showed me that there really is not a record of a Manheim Research Institute in Atlanta, Georgia and so, my search stops there and this email is ignored and delete.d</p>
