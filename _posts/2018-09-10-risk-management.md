In all forms of non-digital communication, I have developed the practice of &#8220;think before I speak&#8221;.   I am continually amazed however that I have the temptation to respond quickly or spontaneously to a social media post or other digital platform when that is the environment with the largest and most undefined audience that I experience in life.

A strategy that I have employed so far as my digital footprint develops is to be careful.  In the realm of social media I seek permission when posting a picture of another individual.  I try often to develop a stance as an observer rather than a contributor. If I am inspired to write something online, I try to give it time to develop it in my mind before writing into a post. I have a trusted editor, many times I will ask my wife for her perspective when posting a comment or sharing someone else&#8217;s idea.

I recognize that it is important to have and use my voice in all arena&#8217;s of my public and personal life.  I also recognize that as I speak, I not only represent myself, but my school (staff, students, parents and board), my family, my friends and my faith.  This responsibility is important to me and helps to govern and guide any thoughts that I may make public.

Finally, I recognize that I am not the expert and as a habit it is my practice not to allow my words to be empty.  It has become my practice generally to share thoughts that have been informed by someone in the know.  Seeking council directly or indirectly on my thinking has helped to act as a safeguard and filter for my thoughts before they are published.

Just as I think before I speak, I must also think before I post.

Listening to Bryan Alexander speak in the<span style="text-decoration: underline"> teaching in higher ed</span> <a href="http://teachinginhighered.com/podcast/digital-literacy-now/">podcast</a> has encouraged me to consider further developing the practice of becoming more comfortable with a variety of online platforms.  Developing a level of comfort would be beneficial to not only observe but to further use digital environments to participate in contributing to web based conversations and topics that I find interesting.  With practice and familiarity, the experience would normalize which would again lesson the likely hood of writing something which may later be regrettable.
