I really enjoyed learning about hypothes.is in this activity. It is a new extension to me. The instructions to set it up were clear and I found the sign up and interface rather intuitive. I can see why it will be a useful tool as I pursue my MAL. It creates an easy way to compare notes with classmates, share thoughts and ideas, as well as have discussion. I really appreciate that each annotation has an option to reply. This has the potential to spur lively discussions if users take advantage of it. I also explored some of the other options and I like that hypothes.is gives the option to create private groups as well. This could be extremely useful when working on a group project.

Overall I found using hypothes.is to be user friendly and a useful tool. I am excited to see how it will benefit the learning environment for the MAL students.
