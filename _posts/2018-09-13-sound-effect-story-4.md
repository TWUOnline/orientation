The &#8220;Sound Effect Story&#8221; activity was a valuable on several fronts. One, I have always wanted to learn how to create and edit sounds, visuals, and/or sound tracks. Two, I was able to visualize a sequence that would accent the pictures on my WordPress home page, and then frame it to flow in an intentional pattern complementing those images. And third. I finally learned how to embed a SoundCloud track properly. Enjoy the track below.

<iframe width="525" height="400" scrolling="no" frameborder="no" src="https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?visual=true&#038;url=https%3A%2F%2Fapi.soundcloud.com%2Ftracks%2F499632099&%23038;show_artwork=true&%23038;maxwidth=525&%23038;maxheight=788&%23038;dnt=1"></iframe>

I grafted 6 sounds together including a car&#8217;s arrival, hiking through a trail, arriving at the ocean mixing in some waves, then returning through a rainforest towards the car again, closing the door and speeding off. I found all the audio files at SoundBible because the other sites either had bad links or did not contain the sounds I desired. I definitely had challenges working through Audacity, but after multiple attempts to mix/fade sounds through trial and error, I eventually felt some comfort using the buttons and tabs on the menu. I also needed to consult YouTube several times to help unravel the tension.

Next time I approach a project using Audacity, I will ensure that I &#8220;script&#8221; out my sequences well in advance. By using this approach I can plan to lay down the longest tracks or background sounds first, then crop in the &#8220;storyline&#8221;. Sit back, close your eyes and enjoy the story.
