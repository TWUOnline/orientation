Hello everyone! I am excited to join with you all to grow in my skills and understanding of what it means to be a powerful and innovative leader.

I live in the beautiful mountains in Nelson, BC with my husband and 5 children. We have been here for 13 years and have enjoyed raising our family in the outdoors &#8211; enjoying the skiing, hiking and beaches around us! Our kids are now young adults and teens and what a joy to watch them grow and become amazing humans. We love to garden &#8211; growing our own veggies and tending a flower garden. There is always something to do outside!

My husband and I are both teachers. He teaches on call so that he can devote time to pastoring our little church. I have been working in the Independent School system as a teacher and administrator for many years until a couple years ago. I went back to the public school and recently accepted a post as Vice Principal at the local middle school. So far I have been enjoying it very much, even though there are almost 400 new names to learn!

I am very excited to begin this program in this new position as I know there are many rich learning experiences ahead. I have titled my website &#8220;Lead Innovation&#8221; because I was inspired by a book by George Couros this summer called &#8220;The Innovator&#8217;s Mindset&#8221;. It was about how to motivate students and teachers to innovate &#8211; take good (or previous) ideas and make them &#8220;new and better&#8221;. It challenged me on how to lead a school culture that embraces the &#8220;new and better&#8221;. How to always be growing. Through this program my hope is that I will find elements in my leadership style that can be re-formed, re-imagined, and re-invented into something that is &#8220;new and better&#8221; both for me, and for those whom I lead.

I wouldn&#8217;t be able to this without the loving and gracious support of my most amazing husband. He has always walked with me, encouraged me, and found a way for me to pursue what God has put on my heart in all seasons of our lives. He is someone who has made me &#8220;new and better&#8221;.
