I carved out time to do this project on the way to a course downtown Toronto parking at the waterfront and scouting out a small area. It included a view of Center island, Lake Ontario, the ferries, downtown buildings, condo’s and some great outdoor sculptures. Although the Toronto waterfront is a study of opposites – existing and new, business and residential, work and pleasure, man made and nature, art and industry, overall it seems to work. It was a visually rich area to compose pictures. Early that morning, the light and clouds offered some unique visual effects as well. What I most enjoyed was busting the myth that there isn’t time to explore ones creative side. It is rewarding when you get focused and can accomplish this is 15 minutes, all with a cell phone.

I validated the start and end time with an easy click getting a screen shot of my phone clock to ensure I kept within the 15 minutes. Not too interesting but served the purpose.

IMAGES

Below is the gallery of the images I captured.  I first walked around the area and made a mental note of some of the subject matter.  I made a plan of what route I would walk. Some of the subject matter was planned in advance, some I just captured with the creativity I felt and interesting images that presented themselves.  It was a fast walk sometimes run in the chosen area and 15 minute time frame. In total I captured 70 images.  Enough to choose from but not too many that selecting would be a chore. I recommend editing with your phone first before forwarding the images to your media library.

I particularly like the first grouping of 3. I had imagined taking a shot of converging lines as straight ones, especially in a city with many examples in building structures or pavement. When I saw this sculpture, it delighted me that there are converging lines, but into a spiral, curved, not straight. I could imagine this triad framed on a wall with a silver frame.  I didn&#8217;t change the colors captured in the editing process, just looked for examples from the list sent.

Converging Lines; Unusual Angle; White/Light Tones;

The second grouping are more realistic images open to interpretation of the subjects asked for. I do like the continuity of light and sky which is available when capturing photos in a 15 minute spread. There are no people in any of the pictures, but can a still image capture emotion? I think Complexity stands on it&#8217;s own, and the third offers a little humor in the Tree and Recycling bin together. The bin is standing at attention and if utilized will save the tree.

Human Emotion; Complexity; 2 Things That Don&#8217;t Belong Together;

The third grouping could be categorized as images that are abstract concrete tactile. The first image is just simple scrapes in the pavement which is a reminder to look all around, up, down and for inspiration. It makes me wonder what made those deep gouges and marks and there is movement. I also think that the pavement lines are planned and predictable, the pattern, not at all. The second image was only cropped &#8211; no color editing done.  I like the effect of just tones of gray and could see the image reproduced in a very large format. Finally, almost any ordinary object can become extraordinary depending on the focus, angle, light, simple colors, composition.

Creativity; Single Color (no color editing); Ordinary to Extraordinary;

The last grouping, while abstract are less concrete, have softer lines.  The image of the hand evoked a lot of emotion and memories for me. I always regret not taking a picture of my mom&#8217;s hands. They were hard working hands, loving hands, small hands. My mom didn&#8217;t fuss with manicures or self pampering. She took great care of our family growing up with those hands, really just a practical extension of her generous heart &#8211; cooking, baking, washing clothes, pats on the back, driving, turning pages while reading. There weren&#8217;t any people out in the area during the 15 minutes of picture taking so I took a picture of my own hand. I realized that it looks like my mom&#8217;s hand.  I also wear her eternity band as a wedding ring.  I wanted the final image to be somewhat ethereal that what is passed down is sometimes physical, sometimes emotional, sometimes learned heart behaviors. I was surprised during the editing and compiling process that many of my images turned out to be more abstract.

Hand; Abstract; Interesting Shadow.

I encourage others to go on a Photo Safari of their own.  It&#8217;s surprising what emerges in a short period of time. It is easy, creative, fun and thought provoking.
