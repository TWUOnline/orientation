<p>I have attempted to upload my Anchor.fm audio and for some reason its not working. Here is the &#8220;embed&#8221; link they give me but it shows up like this.&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>&lt;iframe src=&#8221;https://anchor.fm/e/1401c0c&#8221; height=&#8221;270px&#8221; width=&#8221;400px&#8221; frameborder=&#8221;0&#8243; scrolling=&#8221;no&#8221;&gt;&lt;/iframe&gt;</strong></p>
<p>I did find this information so this may be the reason. It explains that there may be some issues as WordPress has some security issues with using &#8220;iframe&#8221; code. Im not sure. I was looking forward to this working as it opens up a whole new way to communicate on my site and in the future.&nbsp;</p>
