It is very exciting for me to write about the leader I follow and admire the most, everyone has different prospects and view towards searching their leader but my view is a bit different one where I chose my leader like whom I want to become in my future, to whom I follow when I got to know what I actually want in my life. one of the website which gave me a lot of knowledge about his general activities which really admires me is facebook where I followed Dr Neeraj Gugnani. He was my mentor during my bachelor&#8217;s and not only in my field but also in every field I found him working with perfection and same enthusiasm. Not only a good leader rather he is a very good leader which is why I chose him as my leader, in his presence work can be done so easily and effectively that we enjoyed while doing it even if do not want to do so, this is the influential power of him and the trust which he can gain in no time make me follow him.                                                                          <img class="" src="https://images.unsplash.com/photo-1432888622747-4eb9a8efeb07?ixlib=rb-0.3.5&amp;q=80&amp;fm=jpg&amp;crop=entropy&amp;cs=tinysrgb&amp;w=400&amp;fit=max&amp;ixid=eyJhcHBfaWQiOjM1Nzl9&amp;s=d34c4bca14596e2fddf8a196368fb21a" width="185" height="123" />

His ideas are very realistic and his approach is very clear on what to do next. He is always fighting with himself in beating his targets in achieving goals. He never humiliates anyone for his will and work rather is always an helping hand for the other individual always. Below is the link to his facebook id and you can easily know him with his achievements. The most admiring thing is he is never proud of his own achievements rather used to achieve more and more not because he want to earn money but because he love to be involved in lot of activities always. (<em><span style="color: #0000ff">https://www.facebook.com/neeraj.gugnani.7)</span></em>

There is one big reason to follow him is his leadership qualities and always takes care of workers working with him to achieve a particular goal. He used to put a lot of efforts for the organisation and also takes care of worker&#8217;s growth. These according to me is the basic requirement for me to establish myself as a better leader and can help me to further carry on to emerge as a leader.

According to me Dr. Neeraj should now make himself open to more other opportunities, he should print his own biography and used to share his stories of success which help to followers to get more motivated. He used to share that how he able to manage the situation and on what ideologies he used to work and what he usually think while doing his work. This may definitely help the followers to more and is a great source of knowledge on how to be a good leader.

I find myself following his path and principles but I have never been able to interact much with him one on one rather I follow him everytime and used to take a lot of classes with him during bachelor&#8217;s when I developed interest in his ideologies and by following him I get to know what it takes to be a good leader which make me still follow him to be a better emerged leader in life. do you guys after reading my blog really think that following someone is a better way to become a good leader and what are the other ways that can help out to chose your leader ?
