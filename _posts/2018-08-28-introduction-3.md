<p><em>Hi Everyone!</em></p>
<p><em>My name is Daneen and I am a Registered Nurse. Â I have been in healthcare for about 10 years and about 7 of those years have been spent in the area of Palliative/Hospice Care. Â I have taken on many leadership roles in the nursing community, so having the opportunity to go on this journey through the Masters of Leadership Program is exciting for me. Â My passion for Leadership started very early, from sports to coaching and committee leads in high school, to more recently coordinator/educator roles in my health authorities Palliative Care and Hospice Programs. Â I am very passionate about the work I do and making positive and impactful differences in the lives of others.</em></p>
<p><em>I am originally from the East Kootenays, small town girl, but made my way to the Coast after falling in love. Â I am happily married and have been blessed with two beautiful little girls, 3 1/2 and 9 months old. Â My family is my world, so I know a challenge for me during this journey will be finding that balance between family, school, work and Â me <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/11/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /> Â Ambitious mom I know&#8230;</em></p>
<p><em>I look forward to getting to know you all and networking throughout this academic pursuit.</em></p>
