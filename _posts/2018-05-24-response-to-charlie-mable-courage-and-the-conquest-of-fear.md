I appreciate the personal example that you gave in linking this back to how you want to improve as a leader.  I agree with you &#8211; watching someone go through challenges, particularly a loved one, reminds me to be grateful and to count my blessings.  I also find that when I watch someone go through health challenges with courage and peace and joy I am truly inspired.  There are many that just cannot find the strength to endure and become angry, bitter, resentful.  In contrast, those who can remain true to themselves in spite of health challenges and retain their hope and courage I think are truly inspiring.

I took pause for a moment at your comment that you would try to be the person that you would appreciate.  The only reason is because I have three daughters, all very different personalities, who would not appreciate what I would appreciate.  I have had to learn a different &#8220;language&#8221; in communicating my love and my support to them, one that does not feel natural to me.  However, learning to adapt to a love language that they understand has definitely strengthened my relationship with them.  I find that being flexible and open to learning what other people need from me, even though I might think differently, has also made me a better leader.
