I appreciated your comment that the messiness of learning needs to be celebrated!  If only this was consistently understood by all leaders!

I am intrigued by the concept of &#8220;ethical authenticity&#8221; and curious if the <em>Leadership Standards</em> you reference actually include a definition for these terms?

I am always impressed with how comprehensive and thoughtful your posts are.  I am also very happy that you are so knowledgeable in other areas (ie. citation).  You are a fantastic teacher &#8211; thank you!!
