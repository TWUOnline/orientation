<p>Working on this was a challenge. &nbsp;The language used on this platform is mostly for people who have exposure to this so there was a lot of learning and research before actually doing it. Even though I love technology and getting into the nitty gritty of that, sound and audio is much different. Until you get familiar with it, and that I did!</p>
<p>My sound story comes from one of the first sounds I saw on Sound Bible. I then just built my story around that one and built it into a lunch time break on a construction site. Its what I know so it was easy in that regard. I had a few problems figuring out how to download the sounds to my computer as I thought it would work to just to drag them from Soundbible to Audacity. That didn&#8217;t work so I &nbsp;saved to my computer and imported into Audacity instead.</p>
<p>With the Soundcloud embedding, it took a few tries and Youtube videos to figure out that you have to copy and past the code into the &#8220;text&#8221; tab and not the &#8220;visual tab&#8221;. I was super happy when it actually worked:)</p>
<p>PS: and it actually didn&#8217;t work because when I go to &#8220;publish&#8221; the &nbsp;embedded Soundcloud doesn&#8217;t show up. Any suggestions?</p>
