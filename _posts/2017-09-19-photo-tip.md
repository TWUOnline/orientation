<p>I purchased the new iPhone 7 plus because of a really cool feature that allows you to create depth called the &#8220;Portrait Feature&#8221;. &nbsp;I like this because in one second you can take a photo that makes you look like a total professional! Of course, you need to have an interesting subject, good composition and stellar color levels but anything can be done these days with filters and settings.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Here is a link to the info I read&#8230;&nbsp;<a href="https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/portrait-mode-now-available-on-iphone-7-plus-with-ios-101/">https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2016/10/portrait-mode-now-available-on-iphone-7-plus-with-ios-101/</a></p>
<p style="text-align: left">A recent great shot I took trying this tip was at a shower I threw for my niece. Here is the photo shot in portrait of the cake with a &#8220;letterboard&#8221; behind displaying a shower message. A few tries to get things centred correctly in the frame and voila! One click and I think it turned out pretty great.&nbsp;<img class="size-medium wp-image-3138 alignleft" src="http://create.twu.ca/mavenbuilddesign/files/2017/09/IMG_2053-e1505877731490-225x300.jpg" alt="" width="225" height="300" srcset="https://create.twu.ca/mavenbuilddesign/files/2017/09/IMG_2053-e1505877731490-225x300.jpg 225w, https://create.twu.ca/mavenbuilddesign/files/2017/09/IMG_2053-e1505877731490-768x1024.jpg 768w" sizes="(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px" /></p>
