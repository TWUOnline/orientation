Mike Caufield&#8217;s guide wasÂ  a very informative, step by step guide to fact checking. I enjoyed reading through it, and trying out the steps with a few of the samples from his blog.

With so much fake news, viral photos and information on the web and social media, it is very easy to quickly get caught up with the headlines. Often, my own kids or students get emotionally excited about a headline and assume that because it is on the web, it must be true. Thus, Mike&#8217;s one habit of checking your emotions first is the best first piece of advice!

I am always having conversations with kids about the source of the information &#8211; who posted it, what does this person know, check it out before you share, etc.. However, the very specific steps, sites, and procedures that Mike provides are very useful tools! I will be sharing them with my own students and get them to practise their skills in this area. This is a huge part of literacy in a digital age.
