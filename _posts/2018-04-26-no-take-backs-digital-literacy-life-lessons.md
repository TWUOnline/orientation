Posts on social media sites and through text messaging can be vicious and once posted spread like wildfire, even when the original post has been deleted.  Posts and pictures have a way of living on forever, sometimes to the detriment and well being of others.

What is said or shared in a spurt of anger or out of revenge has no &#8216;take back&#8217; button.  Once the dominoes have been tipped, there is no stopping how far they will travel and who they will impact.

Friendships are destroyed, reputations are in tatters and the cost can be tragically fatal as in the case of Amanda Todd who was sexually and emotionally harassed online and took her own life.  http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/british-columbia/amanda-todd-anniversary-harassment-1.4347163

Early education and open, honest discussions are critical.  Students need to be informed about their online digital footprints and about the legal implications of what they choose to post or share.  Most importantly, we need to teach kindness and to instil what Jesus taught us;  &#8216;In everything, then, do to others as you would have them do to you.&#8221; (Matthew 7:12)
