When I searched for “academic articles from Canadian universities on the topic of leadership” in Google, most of the results were from newspaper articles on leaders, university databases, leadership scholarship. Few results were actual academic articles. In contrast, searching for “scholarly articles leadership site:CA” within Google Articles resulted in multiple pages of journal articles published by Canadian universities on leadership. Simply adding the country code for Canada narrowed the results tremendously. I also learned about Google Scholar. This service only lists academic articles and weeds out media, personal websites, etc.

Searching for “articles business owners” resulted in finding no PDF links. I added “PDF” to the search and got several PDF articles! I have often repeatedly entered different variations of a search but have never thought of entering something like PDF in the search. I know this tip will help me in future coursework.

I searched for “podcast Markham” in Google and got a lot of results, mainly from churches and medical professionals. I had no idea that so many people and organization from Markham had podcasts. In Player.fm, a podcast host, I found a few churches with podcasts.
