I have gone through my digital identity search using google and yahoo search engines .Though Georgeena Mathew Palackamthundathil is my official name , I have  recently changed my social media profile title to Georgeena Alphine by adding my husband’s name . It was interesting to see my  google search and it didn’t show up anything that’s disturbing ,rather it was amazing to see few of my unsaved passport size pictures which I have used for immigration purposes and also highlights that I am active in social media especially in Facebook, and of course I am  great at using it wisely to share pictures, events what I  feel like posting but still I manage to keep my personal space . One can easily find my picture posted in google accounts, LinkedIn, KCABC website, Facebook and now in TWU site as I joined Trinity Western University for MA Leadership in Health Care. Interestingly there is none with my name spelled as “Georgeena”. In addition I have seen few pictures of ladies with name ‘Georgina’ . One more mesmerizing fact was that , I could find a bit of similarity in facial features like that of mine with few young ladies with a different name. Did google find out people who looks like me ???? Great!!!

I never tried to google my name before, but I found that if we are into any social networking sites, it will display whatever we have entered in it, so it showed that I work with Classic Life Care since July 2016, worked at P.D. Hinduja National Hospital 2014 to 2016 as a Registered Nurse [RN] and further moved to Vancouver to study at Omni college ,Richmond for preparing to be a Registered Nurse in Canada . She is currently an LPN with Alberta and even about my schooling and so on !!

I love sociocultural activities and actively participate in cultural events organised by the Kerala associations. Moreover as  I am a board member of a non-profit organisation KCABC and helps the association with event coordination, all fields of my interest are seen in Facebook as the associated organisations tags her in their pictures. I love cooking, painting [not perfectionist], anchoring [MC] for events , training kids for cultural events and encouraging youth members in the participation of various activities and one of the recent activity was a Fund Raising Campaign for the Kerala flood relief . There are so many event shares, pictures ,awareness posts about various fund raising events and programs in my Facebook page.

Looking into all these gave me a strike and while going through Kris Shaffer’s page , I gained insight on digital minimization and how one can have even a downfall or even get famous using social media . Need to be wise in this platform where its not only me or my close one seeing, but a lot of eyes are on to it.
