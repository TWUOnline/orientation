I really enjoyed working with Audacity.  With some practice, it could definitely be a great tool to use in a variety if ways.  All sorts of applications come to mind for my middle school classroom.

I had been thinking of a possible story line that could be developed with sound clips that I would find online as I don&#8217;t have a collection of sounds stored on my computer.  The sound story that I chose was built with sounds all from soundbible (http://soundbible.com).  These clips were easy to find and easily imported into Audacity. They were:

falling rain,

a snoring man,

a barking dog,

a crying baby and an

alarm clock.

I am sorry to say that there is nothing to enjoy here, however I feel as though this sound story may evoke an emotional response.  We have all been here and can therefore relate to this sequence of sounds.  Please click below and listen to Monday Morning.
