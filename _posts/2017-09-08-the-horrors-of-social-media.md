<h2>Have you ever witnessed or experienced negative fallout for something you or someone else said online?</h2>
<p>I use pictures of myself from a blog I wrote in 2004-2006 as examples of how everything you post on the internet is there, and it&#8217;s there permanently.  I wrote the blog while I was travelling overseas using an email address that no longer exists. There is nothing particularly horrible about my posts, just some funny pictures of me when I was younger, and some stories of my time overseas. My students learn through that experience, that though I was young, what I posted was visible to the whole world and it will be online until the hosting company choses to delete my site.  I no longer have access to that blog.</p>
<h3>Have you ever witnessed or experienced the public shaming a person or organizations for something that they said online?</h3>
<p>I have seen a several examples of social media horror stories through my ADST classes. I teach students about how their information can be used against them. I have used many examples like Justine Sacco and Walter Palmer (Cecil the Lion) to teach about how attitudes on the internet can destroy peoples lives in the real world.  I have never personally experienced viral outrage, but witness public shaming on a regular basis in all areas of social media.</p>
<h3>What strategies will you employ to ensure that you don&#8217;t become a participant or victim of the Internet Rage Machine?</h3>
<p>The short answer would be to keep my head down. The less visible one is on the internet, the less opportunity there is for people to misuse my information. When posting I am careful of the language I use and the topics that I speak on. Politically sensitive topic should always be kept private.  As my mother always said: &#8220;We don&#8217;t talk religion or politics with strangers.&#8221;</p>
