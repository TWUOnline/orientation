As we move into this next section of the course, we'll be looking at going a little beyond some of the hard skills of interacting in a web environment into some of the habits of mind that we need to cultivate in order to be ethical and well when doing so. Some of these ideas have already come up, but we are going to dive a little deeper this time around.

This week, we are going to consider issues around privacy and data protection through three activities that will get you exploring what is happening behind the curtain and whether that might be a good, bad, or neutral thing.

As you work your way through this topic, it may be worth thinking about the allegation that a <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/wylie-cambridge-analytica-liberals-1.4583810" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lack of privacy protections has cost Mark Zuckerberg almost $4 billion this week as it has become public that his mass surveillance company, Facebook, sold the data of 50 million users to Cambridge Analytica who then used that data to suppress voter turnout in the 2016 US election.</a> (You might be able to detect my bias here. I'm happy to engage with pushback!)

Looking forward to reading your thoughts!
