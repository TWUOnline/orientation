Bantu Blog Post Rank-Talk-Write

I really liked how you tied the concept of &#8220;Designing our Boxes&#8221; to the need for setting goals and a direction so that the next &#8220;box&#8221; doesn&#8217;t end up being just a dream rather than a reality, and the &#8220;steps would be faint for what to do next&#8221; (I really liked your use of language here to articulate your point).

I am following the discussion you are having with our fellow student on integrity.  I also thought that integrity was very personal and internal, so I was intrigued by the Hoerr reference that speaks to honesty being more personal and integrity being more interpersonal and more public.  This thought leads me to believe that integrity has more influence on others than honesty.  Your thoughts?
