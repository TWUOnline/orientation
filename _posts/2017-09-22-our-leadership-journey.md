<p>The leadership program as a whole can be compared to a journey which would take the traveler to different kinds of terrain. There would be portions of this terrain that would be smooth and easy while other portions would be rough and challenging. But every step taken makes the traveler more confident to take the next. The ultimate goal for this traveler is way beyond the walls of the academe. It would be the real world were we would be at times be called upon to dig deep into our bag of leadership tools. We may not be able to predict the time when we would be called upon to rise to the role of leader. It may be in a crisis situation or in a matter of routine. But with the wisdom and insights gained from the journey, we hope that we can confidently say, &#8220;FOLLOW ME&#8221;</p>
