<p>I have done lots of annotating in the past, but almost all of it with pen/pencil and on paper. I have used the note taking function within pdf documents as well as within my Kindle books, but they are not well developed in comparison to Hypothes.is.</p>
<p>Learning how to use Hypothes.is is going to take a bit longer than I thought. I was able to sign up quickly and start annotating, but I know that there are many more functions available to me. I would like to get a chance to explore those as well, but my time is a bit limited at the time.</p>
<p>I would love to use a tool like this in my day job. As this can beÂ  Chrome add-on, it might work on my work computer. I am not allowed to add programs to my work computer without getting approval from head office. There is a researcher who works at head office who uses an annotation tool. I&#8217;m not sure if it is Hypothes.is, but it is still interesting to see what he can do with the articles that he sends us. As I get more comfortable with this program, I can see myself using more and more often.</p>
