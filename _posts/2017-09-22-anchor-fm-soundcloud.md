<p>The hardest part of this activity for me was trying to figure out what to record! I hate the sound of my own voice recorded so I really wanted to avoid it. In the end, I went with background classroom noise for my Anchor.fm audio and a clip of my colleagues discussing new technology during our recent Professional Development session for my SoundCloud audio.</p>
<p>The Anchor.fm app was fairly user friendly. However, I did have to google how to make my stream an &#8220;episode&#8221; so that it would stay on my station for longer than 24 hours.</p>
<p>I could not figure out how to record on my iPhone using the SoundCloud app so I finally resorted to record using my laptop. However, the recording sounds a bit broken up because the microphone on my laptop is less sensitive than the one on my iPhone.</p>
<p>For future use, I&#8217;d like to learn how to actually export an audio file off of Anchor.fm instead of just having it stored on my station. This may be something that is only available in the paid section of the app though. I&#8217;d also like to figure out how to record using my iPhone on SoundCloud so that  I can get better quality for my audio clips and just for general ease of use.</p>
