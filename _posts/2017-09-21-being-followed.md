<p>Wow, talk about someone looking over your shoulder. I visited several sites as I &nbsp;rely heavily on surfing the net for my job. The New York Times had the most third party connections with 34. Schoolhouseelectric.com, a lighting and design store came in at a close second with 32. &nbsp;I loved the &#8220;graph&#8221; view in Lightbeam as it gave a great visual of just how crazy the web of tracking really is.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The third party site with the most tracking was Hootsuite.com with 31. That was surprising so I may need to look into that&#8230;</p>
