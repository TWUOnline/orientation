<p>Robert Tegelberg is a very unusual chap, he appears to be somewhere between the age of 25 and 40. He has red hair and has been to the grand canyon. He has been dunked in a dunk tank at South Delta Baptist Church. He has a myspace, youtube, and google + account that are all empty. The only song on his youtube is &#8220;Kenny Loggins &#8211; Danger Zone&#8221;</p>
<p>Here are some pictures of him:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>What did you find?</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not much. I have actively removed much of my presence from the internet. There is still a Facebook account and a couple of old blog sites.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>a negative portrayal of an infamous person with your name?</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>There may or may not be someone with the same name as me that died in 1908-1912 according to ancestry.ca but I am not going to pay to find out.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>vaguely (or worse) embarrassing pictures that your &#8216;friends&#8217; posted on FB?</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Not really, there are some old pictures of me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>traces of your work on the first search page?</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Nope</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>a fair and cultivated representation of who you are and what you believe?</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>A very small representation of who I am and what I believe. People could make some assumptions about me.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Do you recognize any of Bonnie&#8217;s proposed &#8216;selves&#8217; in your own online presence?</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>The Asynchronous Self: </strong>I try and bring learning to students through a variety of tools in which I multitask across platforms to help them to embrace lessons from their own perspective.</p>
<p><strong>The Quantified Self: </strong>I try very hard to not be this, and do not see myself affected by likes, friend requests, shares, etc. Though it always a temptation to care about others enjoying my posts, I try at all times to not allow the Quantified Self take over.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Do you ever self-censor online? If so, which sites?</p></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I try to on all sites.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<blockquote><p>Have you ever actively removed content because of concerns about how it relected on your digitial identity? Why?</p></blockquote>
<p>Yes. To protect my identity for the future and to ensure that my material can not be used against me in some kind of viral outrage.</li>
