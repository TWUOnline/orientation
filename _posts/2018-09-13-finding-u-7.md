On a monthly basis, I Google myself to ensure that nothing has popped up that I wouldn&#8217;t want employers to see. If one does come up, I actively ask Google  to take it down because I try to carefully curate my digital identity. As such, when I performed an image search on Google, Yahoo, Bing, and DuckDuckGo, there was nothing unexpected besides an out-of-date LinkedIn photo. When I search my name, my Facebook and LinkedIn profile are the first two things that show up. In addition to my social media accounts, my personal bio on my employer&#8217;s website comes up in the search results. Apart from that, I did not see any negative portrayals of famous people with my name. For the most part, average people showed up and there wasn&#8217;t anything too concerning.

In the image below, the two pictures that show up on my Yahoo and Bing search results were outdated LinkedIn pictures that should be removed.

I actively partake in self censorship by refraining from overtly sharing my thoughts and opinions online because I feel that posts and articles can be taken out of context. I believe that engaging in face to face discussions is the most affective way to persuade and to convey my opinions to others. However, Shaffer reminded me of the importance of having a deliberate, public, digital identity in today&#8217;s world. To avoid being left behind, I do support his stance that it is important to stay current by maintaining a digital identity in order to have a robust and vibrant professional network.  However, being <em>deliberate</em> is the key take-home point.

In regards to Bonnie&#8217;s 6 &#8216;selves&#8217;, I would definitely consider myself to be the Asynchronous Self.  Coincidently, the other day I was having a discussion with a family member about how I have decided that I likely will not get a landline because the ring is so &#8220;intrusive.&#8221; Unlike a cellphone that can be silenced, a landline disrupts and demands our attention immediately.

According to a third party search:

Christina has both a LinkedIn and Facebook profile. Based on her LinkedIn profile, it is evident that she went to school in Ottawa and now works in British Columbia. She also has a bio on Cara Interiors, which indicates that she operates the business side. There is little information on the internet about Christina so one would have to contact her through her social media accounts to learn more about her.
