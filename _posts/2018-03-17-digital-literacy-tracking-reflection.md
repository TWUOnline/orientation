<p><img src='http://create.twu.ca/drheatherstrong/files/2018/03/Lightbeam-1.jpg'></p><p>This activity was very interesting.  I was shocked to find out that after visiting only 16 websites that I was connected with 76 different third party sites (see my featured image for this post).  I was only mildly aware that my information was being &#8220;followed&#8221; on the web.  I did not expect this much information to be tracked by sites that I did not engage.  I am modifying what Gary Kovac communicated in his Ted talk a little bit here, he said &#8220;<a class="t-d:n hover/bg:gray-l.5" role="button">Imagine in the physical world</a> <a class="t-d:n hover/bg:gray-l.5" role="button">if somebody followed us around with a camera and a notebook</a> <a class="t-d:n hover/bg:gray-l.5" role="button">and recorded our every movement&#8221; (Kovac, 2012).  If I went to 16 different stores/shops in my town and someone followed me and took down all of my details about what I looked at, how much time I spent in each store, how much money I spent, and how frequently I visited, I would be completely freaked out.  It is sneaky how this is hidden from us on the internet and I don&#8217;t like it.</a></p>
<p>My question is: is there anything like this program that we can use on google chrome?  Why is this only available with Firefox?  Can you let us know what the advantages and disadvantages are of different browsers?</p>
