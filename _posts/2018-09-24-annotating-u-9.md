Before starting this activity, I only pay attention to the advantages of online learning.  As Manifesto declares, it is privilege that we can learn anytime anywhere at any pace.

While I do this activity, I started to realize learning online is totally different from learning face-to-face and it is much harder to study online as an international student whose first language isn&#8217;t English. I have to understand all the contents by reading , even the classmates’ comments and opinions!  In the classroom, I can stop the teacher and the classmates to ask questions to make sure I properly understand using gesture or drawing. Stating opinions to others is is the same way. I don&#8217;t need to be too careful to cause misunderstanding because I can expect the listeners will response me.  However in online study, I have to read and re-read to try not to misunderstand every contents by myself.  I feel so isolated with this activity that hardly get helped. At the classroom, communications come to me, but in online world, I need to go to get them carefully.

Now I realize the scenery of my journey is totally different from what I thought  before start. I would be positively challenge to enjoy this new way of learning.
