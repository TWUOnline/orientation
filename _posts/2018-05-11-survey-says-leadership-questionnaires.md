<h3>Survey Says ~  Leadership Questionnaire Answers Revealed</h3>

Can leadership abilities, traits and styles really be revealed by answering a few questionnaires?  I was curious to find out just how close the results aligned with my own self conception.

The style questionnaire revealed I perform almost equally in the top of the high range for tasks and relationships. My results were equally spread out in Leadership Theory and Practice. I scored 25 in Technical Skill, 27 in Human Skill and 26.5 in Conceptual Skill.  <img class="size-full wp-image-110 alignright" src="http://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/files/2018/05/survey-image.png" alt="" width="205" height="246" />

I wanted to make sure that the responses to the Leadership Trait Questionnaire really were an honest reflection so I asked my colleagues from my former school team, my current school team and my significant other to fill them out.  The results were consistent, all 5&#8217;s except for 3&#8217;s and 4&#8217;s in self confidence and self-assurance.  It was confirming to know that others view myself and my leadership traits the same way I do. I recognize that I need to work on these two areas in order to be a better leader.
