This blog post highlights my favorite picture during last Saturday&#8217;s photo safari in Pella, Iowa. It&#8217;s a better picture for introducing a blog than the &#8220;start-time&#8221; picture I used in the gallery of my previous post. Still experimenting. . .

In past years I have taken many memorable pictures of family events, but this is my first experience with a Photo Safari. I much appreciate <a href="https://s3.amazonaws.com/CRAFTandVISION/Free/20+Ways+to+Make+Better+Photographs+-+duChemin.pdf"  rel="noopener"><em>David DuCheme’s instructions for making better photographs.</em></a> I was encouraged by his advice to make the best picture we can with whatever camera we have.

<em>Picture #9, “Light and Dark,” is my favorite. I was surprised to see how the brightness of the sky behind the windmill turned the windmill into a dark silhouette image.</em>
