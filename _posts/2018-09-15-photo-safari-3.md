I had an interesting experience tackling this activity. It was because I had several objectives that required some abstract thought, I learned to view objects and my surroundings from a different perspective than I normally would have. I used the creative tapestry and pallet of my home as a place to take photos because it was convenient, raining outside and ultimately felt that I had enough subjects surrounding me to complete the task. I found it difficult to find some items, so I skipped over them to others which unfortunately did not save me any time in the long run, but it did help me consider new angles, lighting methods to accentuate each muse.

I love patterns; therefore, the photos that worked best for me were those with contrast and pattern. The photo which I felt communicated the most inventiveness was the dog paw. I moved my dog several times at different angles to experiment with background, but decided upon a nice shag rug that faded off some of colours on his fur. This was an interesting lesson in better preparation and intentionality as it relates to photography and how that can be bridged alongside written work to better communicate a vision or story.
