<p>This is very fun.</p>
<p>To start off with, I chose a simple, clean looking site to start off with.  I was always taught to set up basic structure and layout, add content over time and then spend more time making it look good.  I am also a minimalist.  I do not like clutter. I am a manufacturing engineer; no waste.  I am picky and have trouble finding the perfect image that is telling the perfect story.  Perhaps during this orientation, I will be able to use an image that I have created.  This is why there are currently no images on my site.</p>
<p>The menu option on the top right is for all the details, and I have allowed room on the static home page to see my latest and most relevant posts. IT is also mobile ready, which is cool.</p>
<p>My biggest issue is that the themes look so good, and the background images are fantastic.  But to put that all together and find the right images it takes work.  I assumed that when you picked a theme that the website would look identical to the demo.  Not so true.  I did have to do a bit of research on how to use the current themes.  This worked well.</p>
<p>There is always the next time.  I plan on spending more time once I finish this orientation to go back and adjust the look and feel of my current space.</p>
