<p style="text-align: left">Ever since I took a technology course in my undergrad, I have been very careful about my privacy online so a few years ago I installed an add-on for Google Chrome called Disconnect. Disconnect also blocks and tracks tracking websites on every website that I visit. Similar to Lightbeam, I can hover over the icon to see how many trackers are tracking me on any particular website that I am surfing. The Disconnect graph shows every individual website that would have sent some of my personal information. Both Lightbeam and Disconnect reveal the overwhelming amount of third party websites that are tracking our personal information as we visit websites that we would otherwise consider to be &#8220;safe&#8221;.</p>

After doing some research, I discovered that Google Chrome generally keeps cookies for approximately 90 days. After visiting a few websites that I frequently visit including Investing Guru, Expedia, Shopify, and Facebook, I found that Expedia had the most third party tracking websites.

This exercise was a good reminder to be conscience and mindful of my online privacy by regularly and consistently clearing my cookies as well as continuing to use add-ons to block tracking websites.
