<p>I read this Online Learning Orientation a few weeks ago.  I read all the activities, and at that time installed Lightbeam. Forgot about it until now.  Wow.  There is sure a lot going on that I was not aware of.</p>
<p>A few smaller sites had the most trackers, like bikeradar.com, rubiconproject.com, and tundratalk.com, mazdas247.com.  CNN, WordPress and MEC also had over 50 each.</p>
<p>Amazon.ca had surprisingly few, at only 4.</p>
<p>Another interesting find was that hundreds of sites tracked me that I didn&#8217;t even visit. I visited 20 sites, yet had over 322 Third Party sites were visited as well.</p>
<p>And my default browser, Google Chrome, has no current settings to remove cookies.  But a search did identify that these bits of data stay anywhere from 90 to 120 days.</p>
