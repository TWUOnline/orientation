I decided to tell a story of a couple making and eating dinner. I used Freesound for all of the noise clips. I even used some of the search tips I learned in other activities to improve my searches.Â  I used 8 sound clips in total. The background music was chosen because it sounded &#8216;normal&#8217; to me. I wanted to portray a random Tuesday dinner between a couple with simple background music. Then I brought in opening up wine and cutting vegetables. I cut and copied the part of the clip where the wine was being pour to sound like two glasses we being poured. I ended that part with the wine glasses clinking then faded into the frying pan on the stove. I cut in the sounds of plates being moved around a table to sound like someone was setting it. Finished with an audio click of the couple enjoying their meal and finishing off with a kiss.

This activity was a lot of fun. Editing using audacity was much simpler then I was expecting when I first read this activity. I learned a lot and feel much more confident in my computer abilities.
