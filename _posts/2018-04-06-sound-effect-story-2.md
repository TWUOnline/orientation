This was an interesting adventure. It was a (mostly) healthy debate between what was and what should be.

What Was

I have an mp3 recorder and I used that to create a variety of sound files. I then imported the sound files into Audacity and then started working with each file. I learned how to move the time of when each file played, how to envelope the sound volume (apart from fade in/out), how to copy, cut, and paste sound files, and work on creating a sound effect story. I listened to the various clips provided in the hand out and tried to base my story on a similar pattern.

I am somewhat cautious about using sound clips from the internet and so I created my own clips. That created the challenge of making sure I had no other sounds interfering with the sound(s) I was hoping to collect. That was not always possible; however, I then tried to cut those sounds out of the longer clip and that gave me more practice in using Audacity. There were times I thought I was recording a specific sound but then, upon listening to the playback, I realized that I had not captured the sound I wanted as other sounds were louder at the time.

There were several challenges I had to work through. The first challenge was in fleshing out the story I wanted to tell. I did not start off this assignment with a clear story in mind. The second challenge was in making sure that all the settings on Audacity were actually set to what I needed. The third challenge was in creating the story. I have played with a variety of settings, but still need to spend more time playing with the sound effects. The YouTube videos on how to use Audacity have been helpful, but the whole process still takes time. As of right now, there are elements of a story that do not yet fit together well. I need to know how to use the envelope feature versus the fade in/out and when each of these two functions is more effective. Overall, I still need to make sure the story itself is clear and that all the elements work together.

Waiting for the Kettle &#8211; All that I can accomplish while waiting for the kettle to boil.

What Should Be

When I look at this assignment, the most obvious obstacle that I need to overcome is pre-planning. I worked through this assignment from the top down. In other words, I followed a &#8216;stream-of-consciousness&#8217; model. Next time, I will read the full assignment, reflect on what needs to be accomplished, and then complete all the pre-planning before starting the assignment. Pre-planning requires a completed story board. Once the story is fully ready, I can plan which sounds I need and can then start the process of putting it all together. However, if the story is not thoroughly thought through, I will continue to run into the problems that have plagued this iteration of this activity. The other change that I will make is to allow sufficient time to get the story written. So far I have spent 3 hours working on this project, and I&#8217;m just starting to get the a basic understanding of what I need to do to create an effective story. (My dad, who creates sound tracks for slide shows he turns into videos, has always taken hours to get even a short sound track completed; now I see why.)
