<p>My main goal when planning and building this preliminary structure for my site was to keep it fairly simple and easy to read. For this reason, I chose the simplest theme available. However, I found that the default aesthetics of the site were not pleasing to me. For example, I found the spacing of the font in the body of the posts to be too far apart. So, I changed this by using the customization options for the theme. I was mostly able to change all the spacing and sizing issues I had with the look of the site.</p>
<p>While I appreciate how easy ready-made themes make site building, I also find it slightly restrictive as there are some things that you cannot customize. For example, I wanted to list my categories as a sidebar menu on my site. However, this theme only allows users to place menus in the main navigation location at the top of the page under the header. Given more time, I would like to learn to build my own site from coding so that I could customize my page to exactly what I would like.</p>
<p>Right now, the main thing that I am struggling with is trying to figure out how to register my site so that my posts can be syndicated to the Course Hub. I have already followed the instructions given but I can&#8217;t seem to find my posts on the Course Hub page.</p>
