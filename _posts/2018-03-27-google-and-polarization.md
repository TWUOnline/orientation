Google is a prime example of a technology that is driving us apart.

The searches that you conducted are a few of many examples that we could look at that demonstrate this. There are stark differences between searching images for 'girl' and for 'boy' in Google. Searching for 'boy', at least on my computer (signed out of Google), leads to a pretty young demographic of relatively 'average' looking boys, sometimes doing boy things. There are a few 'glamour' shots of older teens, but those stand out because they are clearly outliers. Searching for 'girl' however, leads to a much older demographic and more often in provocative poses (even with Safe Search on) and arguably not representative of 'average' girls. [By the way, I'm not comfortable using the word average in this context. None of us are average.]

This happens because the search results are determined by an algorithm which serves up images that have been clicked on in previous searches with the same search terms. As millions of people search for images of 'girl' and they click on images of more attractive girls, then those images will come up in more searches, and so the 'type' of girl that is shown in Google searches tends more and more towards more attractive girls.

Now, this example seems to show clearly that, over time, search results can show more and more polarized images, and the same thing happens in all sorts of online media environments.

Watch this short video of Natalie Delia Decker talking about what polarization is. This video is from a short MOOC I completed through EdX a couple months ago.

Our next topic, 'Information Environmentalism' begins with a short post I wrote about scholarship on the open web. As it is, this post is misplaced in the course. I apparently added it hastily and neglected to tie it to any activities. Feel free to offer suggestions as to where it might fit!

'The Art of Crap Detection' is an activity using <a href="https://fourmoves.blog" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mike Caulfield's</a> work in digital polarization and what we (and our students) can do to fight against the increasingly strong forces of polarization in our society. If it is correct that we are losing the ability to speak with people who disagree with us due to a lack of common understanding, regardless of which pole we identify with, we will have lost something important,Â  I think.

One of the concrete actions that I think that we can take as post-secondary educators is to teach and train our students to fight polarization at every turn, to build bridges wherever possible.

It would be good to have most of you completed this topic before the long weekend so that we can all take the break that we need to spend time with family, reflect, and celebrate.
