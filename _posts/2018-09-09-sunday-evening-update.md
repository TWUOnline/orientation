Hello everyone,

Thank you all for digging into the orientation and for your depth of insight. While we are a little spread out over a few activities in the orientation, that is fine. A few of us are just getting started while others are well on their way.

I think that it is worth noting that there are some of you in this cohort that are very comfortable with creating content online, and there are some for which this is brand new and possibly intimidating. Keep in mind that this orientation <em>assumes</em> that there will be some of you who are learning something new with technology, and also that even the most tech savvy among us always have more to learn.

So, it doesn't matter as much where you are starting from as it does where you are headed. Hopefully, by the end of this orientation, all of us will be more aware of how the web works and how we can use it to generate and share knowledge, hopefully we will all be reminded of the power of the web as an amplifier of both good and bad, and we will always remember that there are real people on the other end of our posts.

In order for you to truly get the most out of this online environment, I want to challenge you to get in the habit, even in the orientation, of linking to each other's posts. The connections that you build here, literally and figuratively, will be the key to making this a transformative experience for you. For example, I'd like to highlight a few of your posts which I found to be helpful.

First, <a href="https://create.twu.ca/brittniarthur/2018/08/tracking-the-trackers/">Brittni's post on trackers on the web</a> taught me about some browser extensions that I didn't know about. I use FireFox rather than Chrome specifically because I don't particularly trust Google (although I do use a gmail account...). If you are looking for ideas on how to protect yourself online, I suggest you have a chat with Brittni! Thanks for your input, Brittni.

Second, <a href="https://create.twu.ca/chrisvacher/2018/09/03/digital-literacy/">Chris's post on digital literacy</a> really hit the nail on the head, IMO. One line from Chris's post that stood out to me was
<blockquote>When every tweet carries the power of a press conference, the level of awareness and caution needs to match the level of consequence.</blockquote>
Chris also lists a couple strategies that he uses as both content creator and consumer. You should check them out on his post.

Also worth noting is that Chris has put together a menu structure and taxonomy of categories for his entire program! Nice work!

Finally, <a href="https://create.twu.ca/fourwinds/2018/09/09/the-art-of-crap-detection/">Matt's post on crap detection</a> is worth checking out because he talks a bit about how the four moves on Mike Caulfield's site are immediately applicable to raising kids in our digital media saturated society. Not only that, I would add that Mike's four moves can be extremely useful in academic work as well.

Here is an updated list of participants in the Fall 2018 Orientation Cohort:
