Good Afternoon Fall 2018 Cohort,

My name is Matt, and it is my sincere pleasure to share this orientation and back to school basics experience with you!

Once upon a time, my ageless and highly successful father used to have an old saying, He said &#8220;Matt, when it comes to leadership in today&#8217;s world, <strong><em>if you&#8217;re not the lead dog, the view never changes&#8221;.</em></strong>

I suppose there some inherent truth to that statement, especially when considering it from a perspective and worldview of a baby boomer in the business world; however, since graduating with a BA in Leadership from TWU, there is a good chance that I could probably build a good debate with him arguing against it. Apart from the BA, I also hold a Project Management designation (CAPM) and work as a corporate director with a national portfolio for a globally managed, United States manufacturer of fire protection equipment and devices. I am graced to live in White Rock, B.C. with my also ageless wife of 19 years, one teen, and one young adult, all people of strength, principal and faith.

My best to everyone on this path of leadership exploration!

Matt
