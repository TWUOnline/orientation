I downloaded the Anchor.fm app onto my iPhone and opened an account. Recording a podcast was very simple and was very similar to a taking a video on my iPhone. Embedding the Anchor.fm link on my blog was surprisingly straightforward. All I did was copy and paste the Share link and it embedded automatically. I recorded my podcast in Anchor.fm and had a lot of difficulty downloading the actual audio file. Once I found how to download it, I then had a hard time uploading it to SoundCloud.
