<p>Everyday starts great, but the rain and the traffic can wear on you a bit.</p>
<p>This activity was interesting and could be useful in my teaching, i struggled a bit to find good effects in the garageband library as they have so many to chose from. I found several interesting sound effects on <a href="http://soundbible.com/free-sound-effects-1.html">SoundBible</a>, and <a href="https://freesound.org/">Freesound.org</a>. The problem came in searching through all of the vast effects to use to pick the most effective sound. I don&#8217;t know how much I will be using these features in the masters program, but it is nice to have the knowledge to be able to record interesting podcasts, rather than just voice over blank air.</p>
