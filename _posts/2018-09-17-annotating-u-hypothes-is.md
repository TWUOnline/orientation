I know this post is late, but better late then never.  I did find this activity challenging because as I have mentioned in previous blogs, I am technically inept.  After reading the instructions over a few times and with a bit of help, I was able to figure out hypothes.is. and successfully annotate, which was exciting.  I really enjoyed reading others annotations and gaining multiple perspectives on so many topics of debate.   My previous online experience was using Blackboard platform learning and communicating during my undergrad, so this type of networking was very interesting to me.  The value and benefit that the hopethesis.is tool has in expanding learning and the sharing of knowledge for its users is evident.  It has added positively to my learning experience, added a new computer skill set and enhanced my digital competence.
