Embarrassing to admit, even after a few hours, I still don&#8217;t have the whole hang of it.

The good news is, I have colleagues that use WordPress and I can ask them for a  sit down, in person tutorial.  It is important to me to set up the site so that it is user friendly, engaging to look at and posts are easy to refer to for self-reflection.

I&#8217;m sure I&#8217;ll look back on this post and wonder what on earth I was worried about or why I struggled so much.
