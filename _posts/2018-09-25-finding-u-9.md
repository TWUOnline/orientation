<strong>What I Found Out About Myself</strong>

I have a small digital footprint in terms of social media. I’m not a technology expert and mainly use the Internet for research purposes. There was nothing embarrassing, except maybe a picture of me from my much younger days. Most of what I found related to my professional life. I don’t really self-censor online because I only ever share information about my industry, never opinions.

<strong>Bonnie Stewart</strong>

When considering Bonnie Stewart’s Six Key Selves, I recognize a few of the ‘selves’ in my online presence. My Quantified/Articulated Self has a very low status and scale on social networks. I have a Facebook profile but never post anything. In fact, I think my daughter set it up for me a few years ago! As for the Participatory Self, I’m primarily a consumer of what other people produce and share little personal content. I am, however, a large producer of content in terms of promoting by company’s services. I have a large professional participatory self but a very small personal participatory self. As for Asynchronous Self, I actually like the “interruptive, immediate” telephone because I can tell a person’s tone, emotion, etc. unlike in a text, email, etc. As for the PolySocial Self, I would say my “brand” is that I’m a technical expert within my industry.

<strong>Kris Shafer</strong>

Kris Shafer’s posts on digital minimalism and online decluttering are very relevant for people who have been active on social media platforms for some time. While I’m not active, I did find the idea of deleting old Tweets and information from a long time ago very important. Our opinions, positions and ideas on things change over time. To have someone dig up a post or Tweet or Comment from a decade ago could have devastating results. What we said then might not be an accurate portrayal of who we are and what we think today. This is especially important for young people who share a lot online.
