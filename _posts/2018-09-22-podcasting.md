This was another fun activity &#8211; something which I had never done before, but was actually quite easy. At first I thought it would be intimidating and onerous, but I quickly discovered the ease with which it could be done.

I like the Anchor FM platform. I found it very intuitive and enjoyed the various sound tracks that could be added. I also can see the potential for creating an interesting podcasts with different sections &#8211; being able to record a few pieces, short segments of interviews, and interspersing it with sound bits.

It piqued my interest in podcasting, something that I had never considered doing. However, a podcast provides a unique opportunity to represent a learning journey aside from just writing. I like this as an option for students in our digital world. Many students are into vlogging, which is also an audio-visual representation of their learning and makes learning far more visible than a simple essay. A platform that is easy to use such as this, I can see being a very useful tool for students to answer questions, conduct interviews, and talk about their learning in a way that&#8217;s meaningful to them.

Here was my short intro to podcasting from Anchor FM. My only challenge was being able to share it privately in it&#8217;s entirety without actually publishing it to all major social media sites. I was only able to download one audio clip at a time, not the entire podcast. Still working on figuring that out!

I found Sound Cloud a bit to set up and learn to use. It seems far more vast in terms of services than Anchor. However, I think both are very valuable resources!
