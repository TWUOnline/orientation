Hello Everyone,

My name is Jessica, also known as Jesse to my family and friends. I live in the Fraser Valley with my husband and our dog Brisket. Yup Brisket just like the meat. I have worked in Healthcare for nearly an decade. I graduated from TWU with my Bachelor&#8217;s degree in Leadership. I am thrilled to be back at TWU learning with all of you. Looking forward to the journey!
