cooking (and photographing) healthy recipes, reading, and helping other people live healthier lives. She seems happy and surrounded by lots of friends. However, she is private when it comes to her personal information.

It was actually a bit of a struggle to find myself online. There is a young female snow boarded, Madison Olsen, who populated most of my searches. I couldn&#8217;t even find a picture of myself. In the yahoo search engine my hypothesis blog post came up on the first page. However the only way I could really find any information on myself was to search by my specific handles (which are not linked to my name I guess). What I found was a good representation of the parts of my life I want to share with the public. Health and fitness have become extremely important in my life over the last 3 years and I enjoy sharing what I have learned with others. From this stand-point the majority of my digital identity would come from the performative, public self.

I self-censor online content all the time. There are many parts of my life that I do not wish to share with the public. These stories, pictures, experiences are shared with people that I trust and consider friends. By censoring my private life from the digital world, these shared connections remain strong. I don&#8217;t self-censor out of fear or embarrassment of the content. I&#8217;m fairly confident and self-assured. I&#8217;m not trying to hide who I am. But I would rather share it with more personal interactions.

This exercise makes me realize that I should work to create a positive digital identity that reflects more of my professional attributes. There was nothing to be found on my management growth over the last few years. I should be more deliberate about my digital identity. I&#8217;m going to start by organizing my social media. and going through the old content.
