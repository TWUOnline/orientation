<p>Good evening again,</p>
<p>Trying to piece by piece work through the orientation and hoping that at the pace that I am going I will get through it all by May 2nd.</p>
<p>Signed up for hypothes.is tonight and was able to use the program successfully to add my own annotations as directed.</p>
<p>I am pleased with my accomplishments so far today, but&#8230; cautiously optimistic.  I had no idea that programs like hypothes.is even existed.  I was able to navigate, but it will definitely take some practice to be able to use AND still learn from the content.  And there is still a lot of the orientation page to work through.</p>
<p>On a completely different note, there was a lot to think about in the 2016 Manifesto for Teaching Online, and I recognized that my brain will need to return to what I will describe as &#8220;a more academic way of thinking&#8221;.  In the role that I am currently in much of the day to day comes down to task-orientated, clinical and/or administrative problem solving.  I anticipate that this change will be helpful &#8211; that is, if the neuroplasticity is still there at nearly half a century old!</p>
