While we need to bring some closure to this orientation, I don't want to create the illusion that these conversations are over.

I came across the following tweet the other day and think that the linked post is a good reminder for us that learning in an online environment shouldn't be 'second best' for us or our students.
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet" data-lang="en">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Are we giving online students an education with all the nuance and complexity they deserve? <a href="https://t.co/oMNgE9xxzB">https://t.co/oMNgE9xxzB</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/digped?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#digped</a></p>

I encourage you to take a few minutes to read Sean's thoughts. If I can encourage you to do anything it would be to connect with each other! I hope that you have had opportunity to do just that over the course of this short experience and I hope to do the same with each cohort of students that comes through this orientation. The skills and literacies you have grown in this course are important, but I think the real value of learning on the open web like this is the capacity that we have to build the web.

By connecting to each other through links and hypothes.is, and mentioning each others' ideas in our own posts, we are beginning to build a tremendously rich network of support and learning for ourselves and our students. As you begin teaching courses in this online model, you can be assured that your students have worked through this course and that they will be at least somewhat familiar with these tools and ideas.

Thank you so much for your participation!

Colin
