<p>Good day all!</p>
<p>My name is Tim deHaan.  I am an imperfect follower of Christ, and husband, and a father of 4.  This is my primary job.  My wife&#8217;s name is Kristi; our first daughter Leila is almost 12, Sadie is 10, Jake is 8, and our youngest Eden is 4.  We have been truly blessed with an awesome life, much more than we deserve.</p>
<p>During the day, I am employed as a Plant Operations Manager, working for <a href="http://www.apexfoodsource.com/">Apex FoodSource</a>, a custom food manufacturing company (we are working on a new website, we know it is super 1990). The company employs almost 60 people; I have 6 direct reports and over 40 indirect.  I feel fulfilled working here.</p>
<p>Here are a few interesting facts about myself; I am 34, we live on 5 acres in Bradner(small community just east of Abbotsford), I love hiking and going outdoors with my family, I believe it is imperative that married couples spend at least 1 week each year together away from the daily trappings of life, and my Birkman says that I am&#8230;.we don&#8217;t have time for all that.</p>
<p>Enjoy the course, looking forward to studying with you!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Tim</p>
