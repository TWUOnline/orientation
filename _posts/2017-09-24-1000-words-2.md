<p>Sometimes I think photographs are just about timing! I enjoyed the light in this one. One of our big windows is on his left which I feel emphasizes his yawn to a whole new level! I also played around with the angle and height that I took the photograph so his whole facial expression could be seen.</p>
<p>Also on a side note &#8230; try looking at this photograph without yawning &#8230; it is actually really difficult!</p>
