<p>At first it took me a little while to figure out how to launch the program (I didn&#8217;t see the little box on my browser bar at first).  After I figured that out, then I was able to see the other annotations and provide my own thoughts.</p>
<p>I can see how this tool would be useful to make the course notes that I create for my online courses much more interactive for students.  Right now my students are instructed to just read the course notes and then answer learning activity questions.  I can imagine that after reading for 5 or more minutes you can easily forget a question or an idea that you had earlier on.  I really like that this tool can encourage students to interact and engage with the material.  I like that this tool provides students with the ability to &#8220;comment&#8221; directly in response to something that they have read/watched/listened to.  This would also allow me (as the instructor) to respond to students comments and questions directly.</p>
<p>I can imagine a new learning activity that I would include in my courses would look something like this:</p>
<ul>
<li>Read Unit 1 Notes and provide 2-3 annotations (thoughts/questions) as a response to something that you found interesting or confusing.</li>
</ul>
<p>Here is my question:  If a student provides an annotation on a &#8220;notes page&#8221; in word press, how would the instructor be able to track whether or not an annotation has been made so that he/she could answer/respond to the student?   Is there an annotation feed that you can subscribe to in order to read the students comments in one place?</p>
