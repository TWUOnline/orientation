<p>I do not use social media.  Unless of course you count LinkedIn.  This is the only place I could find myself using Google, Bing, and DuckDuckGo. I have signed up for Facebook, and Instagram and Twitter in the past but have since scrubbed those accounts.  We are talking about 3 to 4 years ago.  Reason being, I just found that I was wasted too much of my life on those sites.  It&#8217;s mostly a discipline issue. I was pleasantly surprised how well I scrubbed the data, none of my previous handles, pictures or information appeared when I searched.  Mission accomplished.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Few additional items I did discover.</p>
<ol>
<li>There are a lot of Timothy, Tim, deHaan, Dehaan, de Haan, DeHaan combinations living in this world</li>
<li>Most of my future useful Twitter/Instagram and other social media user names are already taken</li>
<li>A lot of people with my name live in Holland or the USA.</li>
<li>Some work for charitable organizations in my name, which may benefit me in the future (I hope).</li>
<li>There is also a known graffiti artist who bears my name living in Australia.</li>
</ol>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So, my 3rd person autobiography of what I learned is a direct copy of my LinkedIn profile.</p>
