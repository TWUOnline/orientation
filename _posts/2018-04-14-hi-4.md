<p>Good evening,</p>
<p>My name is Liz and I live in Saskatchewan, Canada.</p>
<p>I would definitely be considered a &#8220;mature&#8221; student as I am pursuing a Master&#8217;s degree at the age of 47.  I am enrolled in the health stream.  I have worked in varying healthcare roles for the last 30 years.</p>
<p>I am happily married and have 3 beautiful and intelligent teenage/young adult daughters, 2 of whom are currently taking undergraduate degrees.  I am actively involved in my local church volunteering on a worship team, in youth ministry, in Quizzing, and in kids ministry.</p>
<p>We have 2 dogs, 1 turtle, and 1 fish in our house for pets.  And some plants I am trying to keep alive.</p>
<p>I am already finding the technological navigation challenging, but looking forward to becoming comfortable with it.  I am also excited to &#8220;meet&#8221; everyone else in LDRS 500 and learning with you.</p>
