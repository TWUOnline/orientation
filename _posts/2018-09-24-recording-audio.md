It was interesting to useÂ  Anchor to record audio . Haven&#8217;t tried before, so I really do not know if this is the way to share . Just check the link !!! Felt there is limitation in editing the recorded audio. Once I posted the episode 1, I felt I could have been better if I have got an idea or a chance to edit the audio to make it a bit shorter. Each activity is leading me to interesting platforms and getting exposure to various digital skills .
