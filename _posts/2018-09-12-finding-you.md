According to Google, Yahoo and Bing search engines, Daneen Young does not exist! I used my maiden name, as well as my married name to conduct my search and none of the results I found represented me.

What I did find was other people’s social media and work platform profiles, information about the meaning of my name and images of those with my name.  The images and videos’ were unrelated and I didn’t find any traces of any work that I have done on any search page.  For the most part, the pictures that I viewed did not have a negative connotation and overall the people in them were portrayed as being happy.

This activity has definitely made me realize just how small my digital identity is, in this very technical world.  I try not to spend too much of my time on social media, as I am very conscious of how unproductive it can be.  Actually, who am I kidding, with a full time job and two young kids, I barely have to time to check the weather!  Also, to be honest, my digital skills are very basic, if not novice.  Even if I was interested in setting up a blog or twitter account, my ability to use it to its full capacity would be limited because of my lack of knowledge.  In addition, most of my communications occur on a secure and private network (working in the healthcare section) or messaging a few close friends.  I am a pretty private person, therefore I am not surprised at my lack of findings from my search.

On a different note, after reading Kris Shaffer’s page on digital minimalism I can definelty see the value of his recommendations for someone who is technically inept and the importance of being “deliberate about […] digital identity”.  I don’t use twitter but I can see both the pros and cons in using this type of social media platform.  For the reason that their is no accountability to the information that is shared, can make the tool extremely volatile and a dangerous environment to be connected to.  Alternatively, when used properly and with discernment, social media has many benefits, such as social networking, professional development and enhancing personal growth through knowledge and sharing.
