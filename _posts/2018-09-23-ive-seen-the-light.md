After watching the TED talk that discussed the third party sites that track your information on the internet, I was interested to see what Lightbeam would show me.

After opening Firefox and installing the add-on I visited 8 different websites.  I browsed between the pages and clicked on a couple of videos.  When I checked Lightbeam to see who was tracking me I found approx 85 different sites that were tracking me because of the 8 sites that I had visited.  The site with the largest number of trackers was Kiji.  I happened to be looking for a rental home for some friends and found a number of data trackers but also trackers such as Airbnb and home to go.

After regaining my composure I did a little research to find out how long my usual browser, which is Google chrome keeps third party cookies.  I found that Chrome keeps cookies for 90 days, but there are settings that will delete the cooking upon closing the browser.

While this exercise did not surprise me, it is another great reminder to be wise when surfing the web.
