<em><strong>My biography based on searches in Bing / Edge / Yahoo / Google Chrome&#8211;</strong></em>

<ul>
<li>1961&#8211;Ray Klapwyk was the first principal of Guelph Community Christian School, which opened its doors in 1961. A &#8220;history&#8221; page on its website includes <a href="https://guelphccs.ca/history/"  rel="noopener">a video and article</a> portraying the school&#8217;s early days.</li>
<li>1984&#8211;Harro Van Brummelen included snippets of Ray&#8217;s experience as a young Christian School principal in his 1984 D.Ed. dissertation entitled <em><a href="https://open.library.ubc.ca/cIRcle/collections/ubctheses/831/items/1.0054665"  rel="noopener">Molding God&#8217;s children: the history of curriculum in Christian schools rooted in Dutch Calvinism.</a></em></li>
<li>1992&#8211;Mary Henry, an ethnographer from Australia and professor of education at Washington State, chaired Ray&#8217;s dissertation committee. She acknowledged Ray&#8217;s contributions to an ethnography she wrote, entitled <em><a href="https://books.google.com/books?id=ZTLIUqwaCccC&amp;pg=PR14&amp;lpg=PR14&amp;dq=Ray+Klapwyk&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=RZJe5_B19D&amp;sig=9Kjl86OISPYnaL3jtYz-E9aOQkU&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfnLvX4YDaAhVEtFMKHd3UDQAQ6AEIhQEwDw#v=onepage&amp;q=Ray%20Klapwyk&amp;f=false"  rel="noopener">Parent-School Collaboration: Feminist Organizational Structures.</a></em></li>
<li>1994&#8211;<em><a href="https://www.researchgate.net/publication/259864981_BUILDING_SCHOOL_COMMUNITY_AN_ETHNOGRAPHIC_STUDY_OF_EDUCATIONAL_LEADERS_CLASSROOM_COVENANTS_and_COMMUNITY_CEREMONIES_A_dissertation_submitted_in_partial_fulfillment_of_The_requirements_for_the_degree_o"  rel="noopener">Building School Community: An Ethnographic Study of Educational Leaders, Classroom Covenants, and Community Ceremonies</a></em> is Ray&#8217;s PhD dissertation, completed at Washington State University, and published in <em>Scribd.com as well as ResearchGate.net.</em></li>
<li>2002-2018&#8211;Ray&#8217;s assignment at TWU as part-time instructor includes teaching and advising. The <a href="https://www.twu.ca/profile/r-ray-klapwyk"  rel="noopener"><em>Ray Klapwyk, Ph.D. profile</em></a> on TWU website needs to be expanded to include writings and research.</li>
<li>2002-2018&#8211;The <em><a href="http://www.rayspiano.com/"  rel="noopener">Ray&#8217;s Piano Service</a> </em>website reviews Ray&#8217;s experience in tuning and servicing pianos since 1984. The &#8220;previous projects&#8221; page goes back to 2002 when Ray retired from the position of superintendent at <em><a href="http://www.mountvernonchristian.org/"  rel="noopener">Mount Vernon Christian School</a>.</em></li>
<li>2016&#8211;Ray wrote the article <em><a href="https://www.slidedoc.us/the-philosophy-of-money.html?utm_source=klapwyk-r-ray-2016-feb-leading-with-integrity-in-educational-settings-leadership-mentoring-leadership"  rel="noopener">Leading with Integrity in Educational Settings</a> </em>to accompany his course LDRS 620 Worldview Foundations of Education. Interestingly, it was picked up by <em>SlideDoc.Us.</em></li>
</ul>

<strong><em>Observations&#8211;</em></strong>

<ul>
<li>Not surprisingly, any news about my life before 1990 was included in websites that were posted since then. I felt honored to be named in the history page of Guelph Community Christian School&#8217;s website as their first principal in 1961. The 1960s and 1970s were important years in my professional life; regrettably, I found no mention of articles I wrote then as Assistant Editor of the <em>Christian School Herald, </em>published in St. Catharines, Ontario..</li>
<li>The first page of every search tool was almost full of listings that actually refer to me and to my two current retirement avocations! It was a boost to my ego to see all the attention I got at the beginning of the search.</li>
<li>In reading <a href="http://theory.cribchronicles.com/2012/05/06/digital-identities-six-key-selves/"  rel="noopener"><em>Bonnie Stewart&#8217;s article</em></a>, I was drawn to the idea that our digital habits have a tendency to change us from <em>synchronous </em>selves into <em>asynchronous </em>selves. Educators, familiar with these two ways of thinking of how we spend our time and interact with each other, use these terms to distinguish between the traditional face-to-face encounters in a self-contained classroom and the way online students and teachers take longer to get to know each other deeper because they are present to each other at different times. My three sons who program for a living have taught me much about this way of life. It has a way of altering you into a person who must be capable of multitasking in order to meet others&#8217; needs. Since I completed Grades 11, 12 and all my undergraduate courses in a variety of modes&#8211;correspondence, night school, summer school, and private tutorial assistance from a mentor&#8211;I learned early what this kind of life is like. It has helped me understand my own sons, and it has helped me understand my online students.</li>
