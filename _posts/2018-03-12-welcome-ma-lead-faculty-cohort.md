Hello everyone, and welcome to your online learning orientation course!

For some of you, this will be your first time participating as a learner in an online course even though you may have taught online before. For others, you will be diving into online learning environments with no background as either a learner or a teacher. Whatever your situation, you belong here! This course is designed to orient you to some of the key competencies and literacies you will need to teach online courses, and it will be an experiential learning journey for you.

I am convinced that one of the best ways to prepare to teach online is to learn online.

There are two major units in this course, Digital Skills and Digital Literacies, with the digital literacies unit being divided into three topics. You should aim to complete the first unit by Sunday, March 18, and then plan for one week to complete each of the topics in the second unit. We should be finished the course by April 15. Keep in mind that Easter is right in the middle of the schedule and you likely won't have as much time to work on the course then.

To get started in the course, please go the the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/">homepage</a>, read through the introductory materials and get started with the Digital Skills unit. You will go through the process of signing up for a WordPress site and begin to structure it for your use in the course. The first critical task once you have access to your site is to create a 'category' called "TWU Online" and then fill out the form at the bottom of the <a href="https://create.twu.ca/orientation/digital-skills/wordpress-set-up/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WordPress Setup</a> page to send me the 'slug' for your category. I've included links to instructional videos to get you started, but please don't hesitate to ask you fellow learners for assistance!

I'm looking forward to learning with you over the next few weeks!

Colin
