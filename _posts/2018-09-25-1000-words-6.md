I spent some time looking at blogs for photography tips. A few focused on using film cameras or digital cameras. I planned to use my iPhone so I found a blog on taking good pictures on a phone.

<a href="https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/good-pictures-phone-tips">https://blog.hubspot.com/marketing/good-pictures-phone-tips</a>

I chose two tips from the blog.

<strong>Find Different Perspectives</strong> &#8211; The author suggest that &#8220;taking photos from a unique, unexpected angle can make them more memorable.&#8221; For this tip, I kneeled down underneath the framed picture, shot the framed picture from an angle, instead of straight on.

<strong>Embrace Negative Space</strong> &#8211; I&#8217;ve always heard that you shouldn&#8217;t centre an object when taking a picture. The object should always be off to one corner. I liked the idea of using lots of space around the clock and tried both portrait and landscape orientations.
