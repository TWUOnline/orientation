<p>Hi Everyone,</p>
<p>My name is Heather Strong. I have been an instructor in the MA Lead Program at TWU since January, 2017.  I am currently teaching LDRS 591 Scholarly Inquiry (online and face to face in Langley); LDRS 631 Health Leadership Issues (online); LDRS 634 Accountability and Performance (online); and I am also the Leadership Integration Project (LIP) Coordinator for the Langley and Online cohorts (LDRS 697/698).</p>
<p>I currently live in Nelson British Columbia (the deep-interior of BC in the snowy Selkirk mountains).  I have four children that range in age from 4-13 and my husband Jeff works for the Nelson Evangelical Covenant Church.  In my spare time I enjoy running, cross-fit, and hiking in the mountains!</p>

<p>This family photo was captured on a hike on the rails to trails above the city of Nelson. My two older daughters are Lauren and Kara (at the bottom) and my son Brayden (sitting with my husband Jeff) and our youngest daughter Avery.</p>
