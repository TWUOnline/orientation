<p>Creating the annotations was an interesting exercise.</p>
<p>I can see how this can fundamentally change class interaction in the digital classroom. The feedback is simple and immediate to a note, thought or descriptive process.</p>
<p>I am not as prolific in my posting or in my observations as some, tending toward the punctuated thought, over the pithy and quicker commenting.</p>
<p>Yet this tool allows both styles, and others, to engage in the material on an equal footing.</p>
<p>For me this fits well into my style and desire for quicker feedback on material being investigated in the process of course work and reporting.</p>
<p>Like it!</p>
