This exercise required a lot of trial and error and redoing steps (and my daughter&#8217;s help). I downloaded audacity to my iPhone and recorded some sounds in my factory. There&#8217;s a lot of machinery and lift trucks moving around, so it&#8217;s a noisy place. I also downloaded a <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Back-up_beeper.ogg">Back-up_beeper</a>Â sound from Wikipedia since that was once sound effect I didn&#8217;t record myself. I had to experiment and get my daughter&#8217;s help to figure out how to edit each track and then place them so they played at the same time. The end result is &#8220;Work Sounds,&#8221; a mixture of sounds I&#8217;ve been hearing now for 40 years at my work!
