<p>Some of the tips I used were from <a href="https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/how-to-take-better-pictures-with-android/">https://www.digitaltrends.com/photography/how-to-take-better-pictures-with-android/</a>, but most of them were from my wife, who&#8217;s weapon of Choice is a Nikon D300s, a wonderful digital SLR.</p>
