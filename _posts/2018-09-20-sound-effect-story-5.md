Here is my sound effect story, created using GarageBand. I had not used GarageBand before, so it took some time to orient myself to the site. Once I did, it was fairly easy to move stuff around and edit, however I don&#8217;t think I was coming close to using all of the available features. I found this exercise to be enjoyable, but time consuming.

My goal with this sound effect story was to use a combination of a recorded sound that I had, in combination with some various sound effects. I looked at a couple of the recommended sites and ended up using SoundBible. I found SoundBible easy to navigate and had a decent selection of sound clips.

For my story, instead of having an idea in mind before I started, I started with my audio recordings that were on my computer. None of them really appealed to me, except for the one that I ended up using, which is of my husband starting his motorcycle. From there, I looked at some sound effects on SoundBible and made my story. Including my own recording, I only used three other sound clips; baby crying, door opening and exhaling. I used both the door opening and baby crying twice.

I find that the story I created ended up being amusing, but also very realistic! My husband enjoyed the clip when I played it for him, for that situation has definitely happened to him once or twice.

If I was to do this again, I think having a clear idea in mind, or storyline, would be easier instead of doing it the way I did.  I would also try to spend more time familiarizing myself with all of the various features on GarageBand.
