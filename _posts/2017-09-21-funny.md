<p>I don&#8217;t usually do a whole lot of internet surfing as a general practice- it has mostly to do with time constraints.</p>
<p>I tried to be a little bit more active &#8216;surfer &#8216; for the purpose of this activity . Because of the recent world events, mostly the UN meeting , I have been looking up news on CNN. I did also surf MSN , and did some online shopping <img src="https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/2.3/72x72/1f642.png" alt="ðŸ™‚" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>
<p>Interestingly , CNN was the one that had the most &#8216; third party sites&#8217; attached to it. I don&#8217;t know if this is what the purpose of this activity was , is &#8216; tracker &#8216; and &#8216;third party site &#8216; the same thing? I hope Colin can throw some light on this.</p>
<p>Facebook did not attract much attention for some reason ( ?! )</p>
