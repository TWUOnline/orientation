Hey everyone, I am looking forward to learning<img class="size-full wp-image-20 alignleft" src="http://create.twu.ca/jgarland/files/2018/09/RCA15.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="280" /> with you.

My name is Jamie.  My wife Lana (who is also completing her MA at TWU) and I live about 5 mins away from White Rock beach.  I currently have the opportunity to serve as the Director of Operations &amp; Communications at Regent Christian Academy (RCA), a K-12 Christian school in Surrey.  I was a student at RCA myself from Grade 1 &#8211; 12 and then spent about 16 years in the fire protection industry before going back home to Regent.  Working at RCA allows me to be part of the development of the next generation of leaders and influencers who will shape our world.

It was my wife who encouraged me to finally complete my BA Leadership at TWU and now I am excited to begin the next chapter in my personal and professional development.  I look forward to our journey together.
