<p>Hi There,&nbsp;</p>
<p>My name is Daphne Luking-Klassen and I am in the Business Stream of the MAL. I am married with two kids. I am a partner in a Real Estate Development firm overseeing Operations and Marketing and am looking forward to all the new experiences that MAL will bring. One of my &nbsp;favourite parts of my business role is tailoring procedures that allow us to work virtually and mostly paperless.</p>
<p>Looking forward to learning together!</p>
