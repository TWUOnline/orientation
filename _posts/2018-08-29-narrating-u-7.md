<p>Creating a structure for my site proved rather difficult. I want to organize the content in a way that makes sense and makes navigation easy. I know from personal use of the web that difficult navigation often results in minimal time spent on the site. This is a problem I want to eliminate from the beginning. My difficulty in it is not being sure how my site will shape up and what will make the most sense.</p>
<p>For the time being I built the structure to have the Blog Posts from different courses in their own category. These can be viewed from the parent page &#8220;Blog Posts&#8221;. I decided that this would be the most intuitive for the time being to organize my site. Further, I created a &#8220;public&#8221; tag. I have created my site so that only people within the network can view it. I do not want it public on the web as I may not want all my posts to be viewable by just anyone. I know that there will be posts that I want to be public and viewable. Having this tag will help me eventually move them over to be just that.</p>
<p>I also created a page to give as I may eventually transition this site into a personal ministry site. I do not think this will happen until after I have finished at Trinity. However, by creating the Give page now, I would be able to link to that in the newsletters I send out to supporters.</p>
<p>I know that as time goes on I will continue to recreate the structure of my site. I think in the future I would like to have a better idea of my end goal in order to better structure my site from the beginning. I think that was my biggest challenge in creating the structure. I am not totally sure what my end goal for this site is, other than to use it for school.</p>
