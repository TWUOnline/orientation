<h1><strong>Fake News</strong></h1>
<p>The first sign that something isn&#8217;t right is that the email would even come to my email. &nbsp;Its unsolicited and is odd that it would be addressed to a Canadian resident but be from Atlanta, Georgia in the US.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I usually send these kinds of email straight to trash because I know that email is 100% not the way this kind of information gets communicated to the public. It also uses the word &#8220;secret&#8221; and the phrase &#8220;fear of nationwide panic&#8221;. Im certain that even the suggestion of this kind of information would not come from a reputable source. It comes across as a sensational scare tactic.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I didn&#8217;t know that the Manheim Institute even existed. Seems odd that a German company would have any connection to our Inspection/Health System. Seems obviously fake to me.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Most governing bodies have strict rules about how to put out information of this nature and I would assume that its done at a Grocery Store level as well as a media level.&nbsp;</p>
