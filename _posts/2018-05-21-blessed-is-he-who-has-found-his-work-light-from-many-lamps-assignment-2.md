The story that impressed upon me in this week’s reading was that of Thomas Carlyle.  The writings of Carlyle echo those of John Burroughs, a man who also realized that work was a blessing and that the absence of work was wretchedness, dejection and despair (Watson, 1951).  Many working people set their sights on the day when they no longer need to work, and I admit that I often do the same.  Yet I am arrested by Carlyle’s statement:  “A man perfects himself by working.”  (Watson, 1951)  Indeed as a leader I need to savour each moment I have been given to work, both for my own personal growth and for the benefit of those I lead, and plan to engage myself in meaningful activity once I leave the workplace.

As in the last series of readings I am struck not only by Carlyle’s inspired writings, but also by his background.  Here is a man who persisted in finding his calling; he did not find it immediately.  From the human viewpoint he had tried professions that would be associated with the highest calling – pastor, teacher – and was humble enough to change direction when he realized that he had made a mistake.  Teaching and pastoring was not what he was called to do, no matter how noble those professions are.  To some critics it likely appeared that he had “settled” on being a writer, but writing was his life’s work, and what he was intended to contribute to the world.  As a leader I need to remember to be humble and admit when I mistakes, change direction when I need to, and not concern myself with what others consider prestigious or noble.

As I reflect on my own circumstances I am going to explore three of the many reasons why this story stands out above the rest.  First, I have spent considerable time reflecting on the last 2 years on my own work as my calling.  I had the opportunity to see John Bevere preach the message found in the attached <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b5jCQkK6Rs8">video</a>, and I am as moved and impacted today as I was years ago.  Ironically, the second example in this video tells the story of one of this year’s Grade 12 graduates in our youth group.  He feels the pressure of following in his father’s and grandfather’s footsteps to go into the ministry and become a pastor, but in spite of the pressure and others&#8217; disappointment he has chosen to go to university to become an accountant.  Similar to Carlyle he would not find fulfillment or happiness in the ministry.  Despite the high calling that the ministry is, it will mean nothing in the end for this young man, or for any of us, if that is the path we take but it is not what we were meant to do.  As a leader in this context I need to encourage these youth, the leaders of the next generation, to chase after and pursue their calling.

Second, I have a twenty year old daughter who is still wrestling with finding her destiny and her career.  I am encouraged by Carlyle’s story because it reminds me that we don’t have to get it right the first time; if we are humble, we can always correct our course.  I started with a Bachelor of Science Degree in Biology because I was going to be a doctor – I had to correct that course and become a physical therapist, which also meant that the years in my first degree were, from a humanistic point of view, a waste of time and money.  Years later I am in an administrative position.  I have had to correct my course, and my daughter(s) may yet have to make some course corrections.  As a leader in my home I need to lead by example and influence my daughters to find their life purpose, even if it means changing course.

Third, I have personally experienced the detrimental and devastating effects of men (gender specific) not having meaningful work.  Due to the personal nature of the situations I am not able to expound on this thought fully, but now have been personally affected by the lives of two men, both free from drug use for over a decade, succumb back to their drug addiction because of the depression, dejection and despair that comes with not having work.  I have observed first hand the truth in Carlyle’s writing:  “In idleness alone is there perpetual despair.”  (Watson, 1951)  As a leader I need to remember, and remind others, that work truly is a blessing, and that &#8220;labor is life&#8221;.  (Watson, 1951)

How often do we dismiss from our minds that our work is truly a blessing?  How often do we complain about having to go to work?  Do we take the time to contemplate how work sharpens us, grows us, perfects us?  I look forward to your thoughts.
