<p>So I took a stroll around the internet and what did I find?</p>
<p>A total of 18 pages of me across all search engines (Bing, Google, Yahoo!, DuckDuckGo). There are a couple of citations of a criminal namesake who is a thief and a murderer. Another citation has one namesake the mayor of Garland TX.</p>
<p>The remaining references focused on my time with The Oasis in Grande Prairie, conferences I spoke at in North and South America, Kingdom Congressional International Alliance, where I serve as vice-president and published a book chapter in a researched multi-volume work, and TWU.</p>
<p>Nothing too drastic from what I already know of me.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve never self-censored or identified as any of the Bonnie profiles. I just do what I do and leave the rest to those with greater inclination toward doing versus being.</p>
<p>My profile appears as an amalgam of accomplishments, yet does not capture who I am. My engagement with all organizations focuses on service and serving. My profile presents the events of definition and not identification.</p>
<p>Not overly concerned. I have learned to be content in whatever state (or province) I find myself. (Philippians 4: 11)</p>
