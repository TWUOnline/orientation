I put pen to paper and started this exercise by brainstorming all the reasons I decided to return to school. Once I had a mess of words I organized them into some common themes and choose a few to focus on.Â My greatest motivation is to learn more about leadership and grow my personal management skills so that I can lead an amazing kitchen. I work with a lot of young students (ages 14-22), individuals who are just entering the workforce for the first time, that come from a variety of backgrounds. This creates many exciting challenges.

Currently I have my menu set up with the following sections:

<ul>
<li>Heart of House: The heart of a restaurant is the kitchen which is why its called the Heart of House. I want to investigate the environmental issues that affect Heart of House leadership that are specific to the restaurant industry.</li>
<li>Engagement: An issue everywhere. How do you keep youth excited about cooking food for people they will never see? How do I engage prep cooks that don&#8217;t even make a full plate of food?</li>
<li>Motivation: What incentives can I provide as leader to improve job satisfaction? What motivates employees to stay engaged?</li>
<li>Development: How do &#8216;B&#8217; players become &#8216;A&#8217; players? How can I train more efficiently? How do I promote a culture of growth and continuous improvement?</li>
<li>Real Life: This might seem out of place but one topic of conversation that comes up daily in the kitchen is &#8220;real life&#8221;. High school students are always bringing up things like &#8220;once I have a real job&#8221;&#8230; I will show up on time&#8230; I will do my responsibilities better&#8230; I will be happier&#8230; It will be different. I try to find ways to focus on showing them that there are lots of skill that can be learned in an after school job and applied later in life.</li>
</ul>

For now I&#8217;ve decided to go with a simple concept and use the menu to organize the blog posts. Then I can use tags to further break down the concepts as time moves on.
