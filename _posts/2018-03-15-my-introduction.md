<p>Hello Fellow Learners,</p>
<p>Teaching and advising at MA Lead has been an engaging avocation for me since 2002 when I retired from my last position in educational leadership&#8211;Superintendent at Mount Vernon Christian School in Washington State. My career in education spans the years 1962 to 2002 (with a couple of &#8220;breaks&#8221; for grad studies and to learn a trade). My many great memories of working with teachers and students in K-12 schools during my career continue to inspire and motivate me while working with TWU students.</p>
<p>I was born near Rotterdam, The Netherlands, and after emigrating to Canada with my parents and five siblings in 1947, I grew up in Southern Ontario. In 1972 I graduated with an Med from OISE (Univ. of Toronto) and in 1994 I earned my PhD in educational administration from Washington State University. My areas of specialty were Western European history and cultural anthropology, and my dissertation involved a comparative ethnography of two contrasting school communities in Washington State. I try to help my students in LDRS 620 and also my advisees in LDRS 967-8 develop a deep sensitivity to the importance of the cultural context in the development of any school. Working with students from many settings around the world certainly keeps me engaged!</p>
<p>I&#8217;m married to Phyllis since 1983 and together we have nine children and 16 grandchildren&#8211;and, oh yes, we also have one great-grandchild and the second is on the way!Â  We really enjoy living on our wooded acreage in central Minnesota since 2012. In summer I go golfing as often as possible on our little 3-hold course on our yard, and we really enjoy putting a few thousand miles on our travel trailer while visiting our family in BC, Alberta, Ontario, Iowa and Colorado.</p>
<p>It&#8217;s great to meet you all in this course experience!</p>
