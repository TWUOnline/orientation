<p>I feel like I am slowly getting there. I had to awaken my old WordPress blog which I started writing when I was in my 2nd year of teaching and still in that eternally optimistic state of teaching where you feel you have time to write a blog! I then switched a lot of my time and effort into Twitter and discovered a world of #PEGeeks that have been fundamental in my development as a teacher.</p>
<p>In terms of setting up the blog and categories, I am going to try and maintain a fully professional site that will include my personal blog, resume, and postgraduate work. I am hoping this platform will allow me to share my postgraduate work with my social media following as well as serve as a place of reflection throughout the duration of the course.</p>
<p>If that doesn&#8217;t work or becomes too difficult to maintain &#8230; then I may think again!</p><br />  <a rel="nofollow" href="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/gocomments/mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com/422/"><img alt="" border="0" src="http://feeds.wordpress.com/1.0/comments/mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com/422/" /></a> <img alt="" border="0" src="https://pixel.wp.com/b.gif?host=mrwilliamsphysed.wordpress.com&#038;blog=67148074&%23038;post=422&%23038;subd=mrwilliamsphysed&%23038;ref=&%23038;feed=1" width="1" height="1" />
