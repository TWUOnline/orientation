<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri">Here’s a third party narrative of what I found about myself on most of the search engines: </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri">“ Dr Simarjit Shergill is a Geriatrics doctor in Bellingham . Washington . She is affiliated with Peacehealth St Josephs Medical Center.  As a Geriatrician Dr Simarjit Shergill is trained to care for aging adults, who often require specialized treatment plans or procedures . </span></p>
<p><span style="margin: 0px;font-family: 'Calibri',sans-serif;font-size: 11pt"><span style="color: #000000">Dr. Shergill received her medical degree from Government Medical College, in Amritsar, India. She completed an internal medicine residency at Lincoln Medical and Mental Health Center in New York. </span></span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri">Dr. Shergill went on to complete a geriatric medicine fellowship at Detroit Medical Center, Wayne State University, where she trained in both inpatient and outpatient management of medical conditions in the elderly. She also gained experience caring for patients in long-term care facilities, including nursing homes and rehabilitation institutes. She is board-certified by the American Board of Internal Medicine in Internal Medicine and Geriatric Medicine. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri">I wasn’t able to find an infamous person with my name; perhaps because it is not a very common name. There were other people on Facebook with the same name, but I did not dig into their profiles out of respect for their privacy . My preliminary search did not reveal embarrassing pictures of myself. I have an anecdotal incident regarding the same– a few months ago a friend posted a video of a group of us dancing at a private party. I discovered the video the next day, and asked her to remove it, to which she graciously agreed . </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri">The first search page mostly showed me in a professional capacity from various medicine related websites, and of course Facebook and LinkedIn . I do not have an Instagram account . </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri">Out of Bonnie’s proposed ‘ selves’ , I could not connect with one particular ‘self’ . I do believe that there might be traces of more than one ‘self’ in any individual. </span></p>
<p><span style="color: #000000;font-family: Calibri">I do not self censor  ( at least never had to so far , thankfully ) . I do not and have not removed content because of concerns about how it would reflect on my online identity. I do admit that I am very conscious of what I post online, for the exactly the same reason . </span></p>
