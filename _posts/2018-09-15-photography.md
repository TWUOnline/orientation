1000 Words Photography

The suggestions below are borrowed from David duChemin [ TEN: Ten Ways to Improve Your Craft. (http://craftandvision.com/books/ten/) as posted in the TWU online orientation

This was a fun activity to do.  I enjoy taking pictures, especially of my family, but have never taken much time to be creative when capturing these moments.  I used the following suggestions by David duCheminI when taking this photo.

I first tried to pay attention to the light.  This picture was taken outside on a beautiful sunny day and I wanted to capture the sunbeam in the picture, but not in a way that it would completely overpower and hide the expression of pure joy and happiness on my daughter’s face.  I think I balanced this quite well and the use of the sunlight in this picture really captures the excitment.  Secondly, I changed the perspective of the picture.  I was right beside the slide with the camera faced upwards, as she was climbing.  In changing my perspective of how I took the picture allowed me to capture the full expression and smile on her face.   If I would of taken the photo just from the side I would of missed the smile lines as she laughed with excitement and accomplishment all the way to the top.  Lastly, I was trying to “pay attention to the moment”.  I took the picture as she was climbing up the slide, independently, for the first time.  Anticipating that she was either going to make it up or fall trying.  The excitement on her face suggests that she did make it, so I was able to captue the moment of triumph .  If she would of slipped, the picture would have not turned out the way I had envisioned.
