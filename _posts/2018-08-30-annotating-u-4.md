<p>I had never heard of <a href="http://www.hypothes.is/">hypothes.is</a> before this exercise so I was thrilled to discover it and find out how it works. As someone who considers myself to be fairly tech savvy I was a little surprised at my own unawareness of this platform.</p>
<p>In many ways, the reminder that the technological world is much bigger than any of us can ever explore on our own is a good one. New platforms and tools are continually being developed and released for the world to use and I&#8217;m enjoying discovering this new one.</p>
<p>The video reminded me that there are many factors to consider in online learning, not simply as a functional replacement for the classroom experience. Having done online learning in the past and feeling comfortable in leveraging technology for education I&#8217;m eager about this part of my education journey.</p>
<p>We all bring assumptions and experiences into every environment of our lives and that is true with this online learning experience in this MA program. I&#8217;m excited to learn more about what I don&#8217;t know of my own leadership journey and looking forward to sharing this experience with other students in different places who are committed in the same way.</p>
