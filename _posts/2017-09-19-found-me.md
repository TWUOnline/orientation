<p>Daphne Luking works at Gramercy Developments as a &nbsp;townhouse developer in the lower mainland. She lives in Surrey and is a graduate in Communications from TWU. She has served on the &nbsp;WRCA School Board and is a member of the Greater Vancouver Homebuilders Association.</p>
<p>My name is unique so I didn&#8217;t find one other person with my name. I found images that were connected to my professional profile but nothing from Facebook or social media. My work came up first second and third most times on the first page. The information was pretty generic and didn&#8217;t involve my personal beliefs. The most it stated was my work bio.</p>
<p>I don&#8217;t recognize myself in any of Bonnies &#8220;selves&#8221; and don&#8217;t sensor as much as keep my posts friendly and fun as a rule. I don&#8217;t think much about Social Media when I post unless Im trying to protect people I know that don&#8217;t want to be included in pictures or posts due to privacy concerns or an aversion to Social Media.</p>
<p>I have not removed content as I don&#8217;t post often enough.&nbsp;</p>
