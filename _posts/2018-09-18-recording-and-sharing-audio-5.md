This was a great exercise for me.  I have often wanted to create an audio or video clip but have not.  Whether there was not enough time, confidence or expertise, bringing this type of recording into my teaching or leadership repertoire is just something I have not done.  I found that the recording function on Anchor.fm was easy to activate and use.  Once saved the file easily embedded into the blog post using the Add Media button.  Using SoundCloud was also straight forward.  As there was no recording option that I could see, I uploaded the same file I had recorded on Anchor.fm.  Embedding the SoundCloud file was even more simple than with Anchor.

The track that is shared between these two platforms is the reading of the final paragraph of chapter 1 in Bob Goff&#8217;s book <em>Love Does. https://lovedoesstore.org/collections/love-does/products/love-does-softcover-unsigned</em>
