At first I found this activity to be quite frustrating. I could not figure out how to get the extension to open! But after some trouble shooting, I was successful.

I&#8217;m excited to use this tool to interact in the upcoming courses.  This tool allows for the sharing of knowledge in such a simple way that I think it will be a benefit to my learning.  I look forward to interacting with other students.
