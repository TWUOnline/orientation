<p>For this activity I literally went by the book . I went through the two articles, and the strategies made sense- until I started trying to apply them to my search .</p>
<p>Out of three activities, the one I had most success with was finding PDFs related to my field, which is medicine ( no surprises there , maybe its because I am familiar with the terms and the search strategies)</p>
<p>I tried to research articles about leadership , sourced form Canadian Universities. I could not figure out how to combine the 2 strategies- &#8216; loc: &#8216; and &#8216;ac:&#8217;</p>
<p>I tried site:ac.ca ( &#8216;ca&#8217; presumably for Canada) , without success.</p>
<p>As for the &#8216;podcast&#8217; activity &#8211; as far as google is concerned , there is only one Surrey , and that is in UK !</p>
<p>As for my home town- did not find podcasts from there . I am researching on how to combine more than one of the strategies mentioned in the tutorial. I would appreciate if someone more knowledgeable could share their experiences /success</p>
