<p>Bonnie Chan is the principal of Norwegian International School in Hong Kong.  She was born and raised in Canada and finished her studies there before moving to Hong Kong.  She eventually finished her masters in HK and then started studying again.  Bonnie loves children and wants them to grow holistically.  She met her husband at work and they enjoy taking trips together to sample food and soak in the country&#8217;s culture.</p>

<p>Bonnie and her husband have a wedding website where you can find out how they met.  There are some silly photos of the couple, but also some nice ones too.  Here are some of them:</p>

<hr />
<p>I used several search engines to look for myself.  Nothing showed up when I only typed my first and last name.  However I remembered a few months ago my husband and I were joking around and decided to search for ourselves online.  I was shocked to see so many photos of us which we had put on our wedding website.  I completely forgot about creating the site for our family and friends.  We had talked about deleting it, but I saw it saddened my husband so I decided to leave it.</p>
<p>I started being more specific when I searched for myself.  I found the wedding website which has details of our relationship including details of our wedding day.  I started searching my name with the place I worked at and more photos came up along with the write-ups I did which I knew would appear online.  Naturally, the principal&#8217;s bi-weekly newsletters also went online for the general public.</p>
<p>When I first went into teaching, I only had one Facebook account which I highly guarded and tried my best to keep private.  However a couple of high school students I taught found my account and wanted to add me so I created a different account just for students and parents.  I am still very happy that I can keep in touch with them.  I taught some of them when they were 8 years old and now they are 20.  With this extra account, I was able to watch them &#8220;grow up&#8221;.   The account also came in handy when I became the principal and management asked for my Facebook account to sync with our school&#8217;s page to do updates.</p>
<p>I have not found anything online when I searched for myself that I did not consciously put up.  I am careful with what content I put online and definitely practice self-censoring to make sure my messages represent myself and the school&#8217;s vision, mission and values well.  This is why after seeing the wedding website again, my first thought was to take it down because it shows another side of me that is not professional&#8230;yet it is still very reflective of who I am.  I have decided for now to keep it there and if someone does happen to come across the site, I want them to know that I am human and can have a fun &#8211; I lead a balanced life.</p>
