My wife Phyllis and I visited family in Pella, Iowa on the Easter Weekend. On Saturday morning we conducted a brief Photo Safari using my LG phone in the downtown square and an adjacent&nbsp;<em>Sunken Garden.&nbsp;</em>We enjoyed the sights of this <em><strong>&#8220;<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/video/newsvideo/a-postcard-from-the-field-a-touch-of-holland/vp-BBIAqQU"  rel="noopener">touch of Holland!</a>&#8220;</strong></em> The <em>start time</em> and <em>end time</em> are correct for all the pictures except number 8&#8211;the happy faces of the snowman and Rogan, our neighbor boy, were taken before our trip. Also, I had help&#8211;I took the pictures while Phyllis held the instructions and sometimes pointed me to things I didn&#8217;t see at first. After experimenting with the WordPress NextGen Gallery plugin, I prepared this blog and placed the 15 pictures <a href="https://create.twu.ca/frommyperch/frommyperch-resources-twu-wordpress-orientation-course/1000-words-photo-safari/"  rel="noopener"><em>on a separate page</em></a>, where you can see them as a slideshow or enlarge them.

I&#8217;m first-generation Dutch and Phyllis is third-generation Dutch, so it seemed to us that Pella would be a great location for this assignment. In past years I have taken many memorable pictures of family events, but this is my first experience with a Photo Safari. I much appreciate DuCheme&#8217;s instructions for making better photographs, and I appreciate his advice to make the best picture we can with whatever camera we have.

Picture #9, &#8220;Light and Dark,&#8221; is my favorite, because I was surprised to see how the brightness of the sky behind the windmill turned the windmill into a dark silhouette image. I picked photograph #7A to symbolize creativity because the sun dial reminds me that ironically this ancient invention keeps more accurate time wherever it is located than our modern time pieces do. We have learned to assume that the time is the same for everyone in each time zone.
