As already expressed by many of my fellow students this was an exercise that proved to be more difficult than I had anticipated.  There is a lot of great information to deliberate on in the Unit 3 unit notes, and ranking these concepts in order of importance was quite the mental exercise.

In the end how I chose to complete this assignment was to embrace the realization that I am, indeed, a Masters student and that this new identity requires me to apply what I learned from reading the notes.  The blog that follows is my evaluation, synthesis, and organization of the material with an attempt at a reasoned explanation of how and why these concepts apply to my practice and context.

<strong>Summary Sentence #1  &#8211; There is much that I need to practice.</strong>

The number one idea that strikes me is that there much I still need to practice.  In order to be a critical thinker there is an intelligence to practice. (Source:  Unit 3 notes).  Excellence also requires practice – repeatedly doing what is good, repeatedly doing what is right, arguably, repeatedly doing what is difficult or challenging until excellence becomes a habit (Source:  Unit 3 notes, Durant (1926, p. 87)).  Becoming a critical thinker also requires the practice of thinking critically (Source:  Unit 3 notes).  There are many traits, skills and behaviours that I already possess or have developed, but I also need to be engaged and intentional in practicing intelligence, excellence and thinking critically.  In my context the practice of critical thinking is absolutely essential if I am going to make the best decisions for patients, staff, taxpayers and multiple other stakeholders in both the present and in the future.

<strong>Summary Sentence #2 – There are many virtues that I still need to cultivate.</strong>

True leadership is not just the acquisition of knowledge or skills, or even relying on my own innate abilities or traits.  There must be a cultivation of virtues that work in symphony with technical competence and professionalism.  The power and impact of knowledge is diminished without the wisdom to know when you have enough knowledge, the right knowledge, and when it is appropriate to share that knowledge.  Self-confidence and determination can be perceived as arrogance and stubbornness, or even as forcing of my will upon another if not married to the virtue of temperance.  It is suggested that intelligence and energy can actually be destructive and dangerous within an organization or team without the virtue of integrity (Source:  Unit 3 notes, Hoerr, 2017, p. 73)).  Exemplary conduct requires the development of skills, traits <em>and</em> virtues to be used in harmony with one another.  In my practice the virtues of wisdom, integrity, courage, justice and temperance (Source:  Unit 3 notes, Bondi et al, 2016, p.108)) are invaluable in the multiple human interactions I experience each and every day.

<strong>Summary Sentence #3 &#8211;  There is a responsibility to learn and gain knowledge for the benefit of those I lead (Source:  Unit 3 notes, adapted from Chong, 2015)) and this will require effort. </strong>

Continuing education and informed study is absolutely necessary in order to remain knowledgeable and intelligent in an area of practice.  In the majority of professions this requires remaining up to date with regards to the expanding knowledge related to the practice.  Followers may be taken in initially by a leader with charisma, but will lose respect for a leader that is not, or does not remain knowledgeable.  In order to lead others well I need to gain knowledge in order to teach and to advocate, be able to articulate and communicate that knowledge in way that are understood, and listen as others share their knowledge.  In order to gain knowledge in the varied fields of medicine I am responsible for I must learn how to be intentional in my study of valid and reliable sources.  However, determining what are valid and reliable sources in the field of medicine requires, in and of itself, critical thinking.  Wading through all of the research available and determining what information is relevant and reliable is time consuming and intellectually exhausting.  But the outcome of the work is worth it.  Knowing what is best practice and evidence based is a requirement for me to lead effectively and provide the best possible service to patients and families.

<strong>Summary Sentence #4 – Faith and reason can, and should, co-exist. </strong>

As a Christian with Bachelor of Science Degrees in both Biology and in Physical Therapy this has been a defense that began in earnest in my university years and has continued into my professional career.  In a science-based profession it is assumed that faith and logic are contradictory and therefore, are incompatible. However, not only is it possible to have a personal faith and be a critical thinker, I would submit that I do myself a disservice by not critically evaluating what I believe and why I believe it.  As a science major and a Christian one of my favourite quotes is found in Isaiah 1:18, in which God Himself challenges us to the ultimate reasoning exercise:

“Come now, and let us reason together, saith the LORD” (KJV).

In my context I have the opportunity to demonstrate that reason and faith can co-exist (Source:  Unit 3 notes), and I also have the responsibility to engage in dialogue and respectful debate when my beliefs or mindsets are challenged.

In reviewing the Unit 3 notes I can self-reflect and recognize where day to day demands and pressing time commitments have dulled my critical thinking skills in areas of my life and practice where I have not been challenged.  For example, since I provide very little clinical care I have not been a preceptor for a Physical Therapy student for years, and much of my practice with patients has gone unchallenged.  I do not routinely question why I prescribe a certain exercise or treatment, and nor do I question if my entire practice is still current best practice.  Has this been your experience?  If so, what are some areas where you no longer think as critically as you once did?  If this is not your experience, how have you managed to maintain these critical thinking skills?

I am thankful that I have the opportunity now to intentionally renew these skills through this Masters journey.
