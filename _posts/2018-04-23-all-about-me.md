Hey all,

<img class="size-full wp-image-7 alignright" src="http://create.twu.ca/awalkinthewoods/files/2018/04/screen-shot-2017-09-03-at-8-29-58-pm.png" alt="" width="196" height="260" />Thanks for joining me on my walk through the woods and my educational journey of self-discovery.  I can&#8217;t wait to get started!

A good place to get started, would be introducing myself! I get called a few things these days;  &#8216;Mom&#8217; (usually hollered from one level of the house to another),  &#8216;Ms.Lacroix&#8217; and &#8216;Lara&#8217;.  My pet peeve is being referred to as &#8216;Laura&#8217; when people respond to emails and my name is RIGHT THERE in front of them.  Sigh. The book/movie Dr. Zhivago was big when I was born and that&#8217;s where my name originates from.  Truth: I actually have never read the book nor watched the movie.   I probably should one of these days.

Professionally, I&#8217;m a proud teacher.  It&#8217;s something I have wanted to do since I was 5 years old. To say that I love my vocation would be a massive understatement! I currently teach Grade 12 Work Experience and Grad Transitions and am also the Career Education Department Head and Facilitator for Grades 9-12 at my school.  Before that, I taught Grade 8 for several years and had the privilege of getting to know and work with at risk students. That experience has helped transform me to become the teacher I am today.  I have been blessed to have had the opportunity to teach in several elementary schools, a middle school and most recently a high school.  It is nice to know the background and skill set knowledge that aids in scaffolding of material which helps enable student transition from one level to the next.

Personally, I&#8217;m the proud mom of 2 amazing kids (20 and 17 years old), a floppy eared German Shepherd dog and 2 hamsters.  I love to camp, hike, read, explore new places, be outdoors, eat and laugh (not necessarily in that order)!
