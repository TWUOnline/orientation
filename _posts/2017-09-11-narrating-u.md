<p>My knowledge and skills in creating and maintaining a blog is nil.  It took me a while to figure out themes, but after I played around with a couple of them, I appreciated the selection.  I also took the time to try and understand all the different options for several of the themes before selecting the one I liked the most.  It took me much longer than I had expected to figure out this very first step.  This is definitely unfamiliar territory for me, but the good news is that I played around with it and am feeling more and more confident.</p>
<p>I like things organised and tidy, and noticed that it made an impact on how I structured and selected the theme for my blog.  I wanted something that looked &#8220;clean&#8221;, straightforward, and easy to read and navigate through.  The theme I chose had many dummy posts which confused me at first and I had to go in and delete all of them, but now I appreciate them because it let me know what my future posts would look like.</p>
<p>I started with the &#8220;tagline&#8221; and then selected a header image based on my tagline &#8211; head + heart + action.  I wanted an image that was peaceful, reflective and calming.  From there, I played with the background colours to match my image and began my &#8220;About Me&#8221; page.</p>
<p>Taking the time to play around with all the options helped me greatly.  However, there is still much to learn as I go through the online learning orientation.</p>
