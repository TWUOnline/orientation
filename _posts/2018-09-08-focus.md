Keep them focused! Incorporating technology into the learning environment is now common practice. Technology provides unlimited resources,  student support and effective organization of student work, it also provides distraction.  Students can at times get lost down a rabbit trail following one piece of information to the next just as adults often do.  Using an extension like<a href="https://web.hypothes.is/"><em> Hypothesis</em></a> keeps students working in an enclosed area where they are less likely to wander.  This will help them practice effective digital time management and focus.

Using <em><a href="https://web.hypothes.is/">Hypothesis</a> </em>helps students stay focused in another manner as well.  By focusing on a single article, or other piece of information, students can learn to comment in a concise and articulate manner while maintaining both voice and choice in their decision making about their topic.  Developing digital skills and improving student focus and time management could all be accomplished through the use of this extension.  It would be great to try with students.
