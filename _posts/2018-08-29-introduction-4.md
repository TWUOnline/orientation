<p>Hey everyone &#8211; great to be connected this way and I&#8217;m looking forward to this education journey we&#8217;ll be sharing together.</p>
<p>My wife, Sonya, and I live east of Toronto with our four incredible kids. We have the amazing privilege of living on a rural 2-acre property where we keep chickens and bees with lots of rooms for our dogs to run.</p>

<p>I&#8217;m a pastor at <a href="http://www.c4church.com/"  rel="noopener">C4 Church</a> where I oversee all of our multisite ministry as well as our worship services at our three locations. I&#8217;ve been in church ministry full time since 2005 and am so grateful for the opportunity to lead and serve my community in this way.</p>
<p>Leadership has looked different for me at different stages of my life but always something that I&#8217;ve pursued. From helping run camp programs to conferences to songwriting retreats to community events, I&#8217;ve always looked for ways to serve others by coming alongside and leading the way together.</p>
<p>Over the last 10 years or so I&#8217;ve been able to share what I&#8217;ve been learning around creative leadership on my blog and through social media. You can visit <a href="http://www.chrisvacher.com/"  rel="noopener">www.chrisvacher.com</a> to find out more about me and what I&#8217;m passionate about!</p>
