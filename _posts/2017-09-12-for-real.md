<p>I don&#8217;t trust anything in the email,  Nothing at all, and I am not a normal skeptic.  They use ambiguous information, like &#8216;several&#8217;, and name drop without citing any sources or real people.  THere are emotional elements to it, like, &#8216;we feel&#8217;.  There is nothing scientific or data driven reasoning behind what is written.  Who, what name, which person, wrote this article, and when.  Do they show any data, and how was it collected.  Who verified it, and when.  How did the data collection process work? How is each of the facts proven in detail?    How do they know that a government agency secretly did anything?</p>
<p>Well, after taking LDRS 591 Scholarly Inquiry, there are many more questions to ask. Next thing you know, they will be telling us that there are flesh eating bacteria in coconut oil.</p>
