<span style="color: #ff0000"><strong>Principles of servant leadership </strong></span>

Servant leadership as defined in nothouse pg 226 &#8221; <em>begins with the natural feeling that one wants to </em><em>serve, to serve first. Then conscious choice brings one to aspire to </em><em>lead. . . .&#8221;.</em>

Servant leadership is not just the term rather it is a feeling a person have being a leader, northouse describes a lot of principles in an effective way and many of them are more or less very challenging in real practice of a leader as stated by spears (2002) there are ten characteristics of servant leadership and being in a medical field I found the  context and culture which is listed in the antecedent conditions of Northouse, it describes that how servant leadership is carried out in an organisation, during my bachelor&#8217;s in the medical field I found it most difficult sometimes to care of each individual even if I know I could even catch the disease but for the context of patient I have to serve them in the best possible way and working in an environment where I know It can harm me but this is what we learned to serve not to just gain and fill up the pockets with lots of money, it truly means doing the things for them first then think of ourselves.

The second principle which I found  is awareness, during my day to day life, I keep myself asking a question Am i seriously aware of what I am doing ?, Do I seriously know about everything to the end, this is an indispensable trait a servant leadership should have that is awareness for the welfare of other people  for example during my internship period in bachelor&#8217;s of dental surgery I found it challenging with new cases in day to day life, as said in dentistry &#8220;you might have done thousands of root canal treatment but still the next case can be totally new&#8221;, you should always be aware of what is new coming and about the updates in dental field for the welfare of the patient and the society.

The third principle which I found is helping followers grow and succeed, this should be the agenda of every servant leader to help their workers and to support them for their welfare. a good example of this is my dad, he owns a company of blankets where workers manufacture blankets in factories. He always take care of his workers, keep on boosting them up, giving them gifts on doing work properly and always every year given promotion and always take care of their emotions and sometimes, work with them as a team during tough times, this is the most important trait which held an organisation to be successful.

The three most challenging principles which I found is listening, I know listening is a good habit and we all should attain it but for me I found it most challenging because it make me think always am I really listening ? Do I really imply what I listened and have I listened carefully ?, the second challenging principle is Empowering, till now I do not understand the fact that if the workers are empowered than what is the need of leaders, if they are given powers which the leaders posses how can an organisation be able to run with so many people having same powers, this thought make this principle more challenging for me and the  third one is awareness which I still think I&#8217;m not aware of everything but serving a group of people means one should have to be aware of everything. so, as to serve in the best possible way.

So, at the end of my blog I&#8217;m again putting a question do you guys really think empowering should be a principle of servant leadership ? I know it is most annoying question but still think of all the prospects and do let me know, do you find it apt ?
