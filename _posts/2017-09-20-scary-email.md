<p>To check the authenticity of the email, I would first apply the strategies mentioned in Michael Caulfield&#8217;s guide.  First of all I would try and find if any other searches of this kind have been done by one of the numerous reliable sites mentioned in his book. I would then try to &#8216; go upstream&#8217; and trace the source of the email. &#8216; Highlight&#8217; and &#8216; right click&#8217; in chrome seems like a very versatile tool ; I would apply that to certain key phrases in the text .</p>
<p>The email does seem sketchy. One of the first things that stands out is the tone &#8211; dramatic and scandalizing , meant to scare .  There are also spelling and grammatical mistakes, seems like its written in a hurry . The language is very &#8216; lay &#8216; , without the technical terms or specifics that one would expect from the CDC .</p>
<p>I did know that the Manheim institute was a part of the CDC</p>
