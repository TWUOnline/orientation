In this intangible social networking globe the rampant use and spread of fake messages/hoax by mendacious minds is untrammeled with legal control and is in fact  fueled with the increase of accessibility to free or cheap internet. The majority chunk of such shared misinformation are stale and are mostly only to induce fear in the minds of people and make them think or act in a particular manner for malafide intentions. These data are circulated way more faster than we can imagine as those who forward it or share it don&#8217;t really go to see or check it&#8217;s authenticity. It spreads like wild fire.

In the wake of the proliferation of such  misinformation, digital literacy becomes indispensable. Not many realize the consequence of such misinformation being circulated. These information varies from topics related to breakout of viruses to winning lotteries a hundred times. The other day I received a message that is related to the spread of Ebola. The same message was making rounds in the networking world few years back and the exposure to that fact helped me to not really dig into it&#8217;s authenticity and further refrained me from further sharing it. But those who lack such exposure to this existing social world end up usually becoming the victims to such unscrupulous practice.

Michael Caulfield’s clearly laid down  the guidelines that really help in the scrutinization of such information before even giving a thought to believe it. His fact checking techniques in the four moves in his guide basically enlightens us to check the authenticity of the messages on the internet  by going to the root of such information and also checking laterally the trustworthiness of the information from other&#8217;s and accordingly decide if it is a genuine piece of information that needs to be believed first and shared. Also as an additional tactic or tip to deal with this menace, he points out to the importance or the influence of emotional status of the individual while doing so, as those who are emotionally stirred up with the information can be biased while checking the authenticity of the given piece of data. The frame of mind of such individual&#8217;s are not really suitable to genuinely check the same without any predispositions. In such situations we need to stop at the thought of sharing it. So we are to be cautious while believing in such information and see that it is not further shared unless we check it&#8217;s genuineness and authenticity and are assured of the same.
