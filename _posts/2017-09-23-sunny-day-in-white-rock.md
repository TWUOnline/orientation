<p>I decided to convert my weekend morning walk into Photo Safari . I could not take a specific picture to demonstrate start or finish time , it was in the morning around 9 am . My walking route typically takes me down a steep hill to White Rock beach, and then back up. The walk itself is an exhilarating experience, one because I get to do it only the weekends, and second because it takes me through this changing landscape d own to the sea . My words cant do it justice.</p>
<p>Today was especially enlightening, because I wasn&#8217;t just a casual observer but was a photographer ! I was looking at the usual things in a different perspective</p>

Don&#8217;t know what it means</p>

<p>Issues I had with this activity &#8211; I was trying to copy a folder , did not happen.Â  I learnt that you can only copy them one by one</p>
<p>For the life of my I cannot understand why all my photos are displayed sideways!! All my attempts to make them upright went waste.Â  I apologise for the &#8216; pain in the neck &#8216;</p>
