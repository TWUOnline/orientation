<h4>Hodge Podgy and definitively obtuse.</h4>

My experience on the Google Moogly exercise.

The image exercise was interesting.  I recorded only first page findings, but interesting nonetheless.

<ul>
<li style="text-align: left">The Professor image search netted a 32 image first page with 29 men depicted as professors, 2 women and 1 Donald Trump???<img class="alignnone wp-image-31 " style="width: 20px;height: 33px;text-align: left;color: #333333;text-indent: 0px;letter-spacing: normal;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;text-decoration: none;max-width: 580px;background-color: transparent" src="http://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/WHAT.jpg" alt="" width="176" height="286" /> The images were <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;font-family: 'Libre Franklin','Helvetica Neue',helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;list-style-type: disc;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">multi-racially</span> mixed throughout.</li>
<li>Teacher images demonstrated the opposite gender bias with 27 images depicting 21 women, 6 men and no image of Donald Trump.<img class="alignnone  wp-image-32" style="width: 40px;height: 40px;text-align: left;color: #333333;text-indent: 0px;letter-spacing: normal;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;text-decoration: none;max-width: 580px;background-color: transparent" src="http://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/Whew.jpg" alt="" width="300" height="300" srcset="https://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/Whew.jpg 300w, https://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/Whew-150x150.jpg 150w, https://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/Whew-100x100.jpg 100w" sizes="(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px" />  <b></b><i></i><u></u>These images were also multi-racially mixed throughout.</li>
<li>Leader pics garnered 28 images &#8211; 5 photos of men, 23 animations with 14 portraying men as leaders, 3 portraying women and 6 gender neutral. Also multi-racially mixed throughout.</li>
<li>Doctors images (33) portrayed 15 males, 10 female whereas nurse images (29) depicted 3 men and 26 women. These two groups portrayed a predominantly white racial profile.</li>
<li>Boy images (35) were all male with three depicting boys with physical deformities, 4 depicting boys over 12 and 28 depicting boys between under 12. The headings on the site focused mostly on physical attributes of boys like hair colour, strength, etc.</li>
<li>Girl images (29) only showed 6 under 12, 2 with physical deformities and 21 over 12. The headings in this section also focused on physical and emotional attributes of girls and the seasons. <img class="alignnone wp-image-34 size-full" src="http://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/images-e1522172558905.png" alt="" width="11" height="26" /></li>
<li> 27 teenager images depicted male and female fairly <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;font-family: 'Libre Franklin','Helvetica Neue',helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;list-style-type: disc;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">evenly, with the majority depicting a racially white presentation, with pictures of the teenagers engaging in eating, music and friendship. The heading were mostly focused on racial differences between teenagers and attitudes of teenagers. <img class="alignnone  wp-image-35" style="width: 49px;height: 25px;text-align: left;color: #333333;text-indent: 0px;letter-spacing: normal;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;text-decoration: none;max-width: 580px;background-color: transparent" src="http://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/download-300x154.jpg" alt="" width="90" height="46" srcset="https://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/download-300x154.jpg 300w, https://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/download.jpg 313w" sizes="(max-width: 90px) 100vw, 90px" /></span><b></b><i></i><u></u></li>
</ul>

Moving to the Canadian Universities and Leadership search, the results were mostly about universities or organizations offering leadership Programs and not directly about leadership. TWU did get a mention as one of the top 11 universities offering leadership programs.  <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-36" src="http://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/images-e1522173325648.jpg" alt="" width="28" height="13" />

The Canadian Christian Ministry and Nonprofit pdf search did not really bring anything out but how to&#8217;s, rules and constitutions for existing ministries. No real in-depth anything.

The Podcasts from Victoria were numerous. You can follow this link to access Victoria This Week for all things Victoria. <img class="alignnone size-full wp-image-37" src="http://create.twu.ca/alwaysleadership/files/2018/03/220px-Podcasting_icon-e1522173761616.png" alt="" width="16" height="16" />(http://victoriathisweek.blubrry.com/)

Overall lacklustre, but interesting.

Curioser and curioser!
