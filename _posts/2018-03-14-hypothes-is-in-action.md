<p>Hypothes.is has many possibilities for online teaching.  I can see how the networked relationships privileged by this activity using the APP is very helpful for deep learning.</p>
<p>Teachers can annotate a document as a reading guide so that when it is posted and students read it they are able to focus on key points as well as be encouraged to annotate with their own questions/comments so that they are directing the learning and the instructor can respond.  This process encourages close reading and builds in accountability.  I can imagine that reading becomes more of an engaged process and that the interaction with the text could become lively due to the possibility of embedding links, images and videos.  I can also see the possibilities for peer review.  Active reading strategies are triggered and readers employ both affective and intellectual perspectives.</p>
<p>I have a couple of questions for further exploration:</p>
<ul>
<li>Can annotated documents be considered scholarly work and get scholarly credit.</li>
<li>How can the expertise of the annotator be evaluated?I experimented with annotating the<a href="http://learn.twu.ca/pluginfile.php/62706/mod_resource/content/2/LDRS%20624%20Syllabus%202018.pdf"> syllabus for my upcoming LDRS 624 course</a>.  When I was practising with the Manifesto document I neglected to add tags (sorry Colin) but I did successfully do this on the syllabus document so have learned how to do this!   I&#8217;m going to experiment more with this App in my classes.</li>
