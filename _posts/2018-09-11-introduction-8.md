Hi everyone, my name is Norm Beange. You might be wondering how to pronounce my last name &#8211; pretend there&#8217;s no &#8216;e&#8217; at the end and pronounce it like &#8220;Benj&#8221; in &#8220;Benjamin.&#8221; I&#8217;m 71 (I think that&#8217;s the definition of &#8220;mature student&#8221;) and my wife and I have 3 adult children (our eldest son was killed in an automobile accident in 2004) and 6 grandchildren!

I own and manage a Toronto-based manufacturing company that produces highly customized marketing and consumer that has about 65 employees. It fits that my Myers-Briggs personality type is &#8220;Entrepreneur.&#8221; <span style="float: none;background-color: transparent;color: #333333;cursor: text;font-family: 'Libre Franklin','Helvetica Neue',helvetica,arial,sans-serif;font-size: 16px;font-style: normal;font-variant: normal;font-weight: 400;letter-spacing: normal;text-align: left;text-decoration: none;text-indent: 0px">My spiritual gift is exhortation and my love language is affirmation so m</span>y goal in taking this program is to gain more knowledge to write a book about leadership development in the local church and to have the academic credibility to do so.

My main hobby is reading; I read mostly non-fiction on sociology, human behavior and leadership. I look forward to journeying with all of you in this online world of education â€¦ it&#8217;s certainly going to be a learning experience for me.
